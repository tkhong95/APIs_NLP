There aren't many places without servers, Starbucks is one of the few ones and a coffee is more expensive than a full meal. And their coffee tastes like sugary dirt. \\n\\nI know libraries exist, they close by 5pm, I go to the diner after that.

       "  'human_answer': 'Ok…I’m NOT a typical redditor…I’m an old married lady.  Your husband is a man baby.  He’s forcing you into apologizing.  You don’t owe  him anything.  Personally I’d take his silence as a blessing and use the opportunity to just text him things to do.\\n\\nDo not let him manipulate you into apologizing for his shitty behavior.  You’re just rewarding and reinforcing his tantrum.  You’re a mother, you’d not tolerate this in your children.\\n\\nYes it is sad you have to treat him as a child but he chose to act like one.',\n",
       "  'ai_answer': 'It can be difficult to handle the silent treatment from your husband, especially if you don’t know why he’s giving it to you. The best thing to do in this situation is to try to talk to him calmly and openly about what is going on. Ask him why he is giving you the silent treatment and try to listen to what he has to say without getting defensive. It may also be helpful to apologize for anything you may have done that could have caused the rift between you two. If he is still not willing to talk, it may be best to seek counseling or advice from a third-party to help you both work through your issues.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'Why do I get more attention when I am wearing a ring?',\n",
       "  'human_answer': 'Are they actively flirting with you or just talking? It could be that they just feel more comfortable talking to you knowing you’re not there to hook up (cause they think you’re married)',\n",
       "  'ai_answer': 'It is likely that people are drawn to the ring because it symbolizes something important to them, such as a commitment or a promise. The ring may also signify wealth or status, which can be attractive to some people. Additionally, a ring may be seen as a sign of maturity or responsibility, which can be appealing to many people.'},\n",

       "  'human_answer': \"If it isn't busy and you make a purchase, you're fine.\",\n",
       "  'ai_answer': \"It depends on the restaurant/café and the circumstances. While it is generally considered polite to limit one's stay in a restaurant/café to a reasonable amount of time, many places are happy to accommodate customers who wish to stay longer. It is a good idea to check with the staff to ensure that they are comfortable with your extended stay.\"},\n",

He has stated that he still loves making music and connecting with his fans. It's likely that performing is a way for him to express himself and connect with others, and he likely still enjoys it despite the fame.\"},\n",

Explain the importance of keeping a tidy house and how it affects everyone’s quality of life.\\n\\n3. Set clear expectations of what needs to be done and when it needs to be done.\\n\\n4. Provide rewards and incentives for helping out with household chores.\\n\\n5. Make it fun. Create a game or competition to see who can clean up the quickest or most efficiently.\\n\\n6. Involve your children in the process. Show them how to clean up properly and help them develop a sense of pride in their work.\\n\\n7. Show appreciation for their efforts.

       "  'ai_answer': 'The \"In Memory Of\" stickers are often placed on cars in honor of a deceased loved one. They are a way to remember and honor the life and memory of a person who has passed away. The stickers can also be used to commemorate a special event or milestone in a person\\'s life, such as a wedding, graduation, or anniversary.'},\n",

       "  'human_answer': \"Get on a regular sleep schedule to regulate your body's circadian rhythm. Exercise. Lift weights to build muscle, and do cardio-- your body will demand calories and protein if you train your metabolism to grow and use it.\",\n",
       "  'ai_answer': 'Yes, many people feel like eating is a chore. To change this mentality, it is important to focus on the pleasure that eating can bring. Take the time to plan meals that appeal to your taste buds and experiment with different flavors. Think of food as an opportunity to nourish your body and enjoy the flavors of the world. Make mealtime a social experience by inviting friends and family to join you in the kitchen. Finally, make sure to take the time to savor each bite and appreciate the meal you have prepared.'},\n",

       "  'ai_answer': 'It is impossible to answer this question because the outcome of a conflict between the United States and North Korea is highly unpredictable. Any conflict between the two nations would likely be a long and costly affair, and the outcome is impossible to predict.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'How do I tell someone they won’t be hired back next summer for a seasonal job?',\n",
       "  'human_answer': 'My summer job used to give us three options- rehire, reinterview, or don’t come back. If they’re good kids you could give them the reinterview option and see if they’ve matured come next summer. Kids can make a big jump when it comes to responsibility in just one school year.',\n",
       "  'ai_answer': \"The best way to tell someone they won't be hired back for a seasonal job is to be honest and direct. It's important to be respectful and understanding of their circumstances. Begin the conversation by thanking them for their work and dedication to the job. Explain to them that due to changing business needs, they will not be hired back for the next season. Be sure to offer any additional resources or advice that may help them find a new job or further their career.\"},\n",

Heck, even just the threat of a lawsuit can make them jump off their chairs and do something.\\n\\nIf not, then go to your staff and tell them what's happening so it can be dealt with in short order.\\n\\nIn the meantime, find a group of friends that will be there for you.\",\n",
       "  'ai_answer': \"When someone calls you the N-word, it can be very hurtful and upsetting. It is important to remember that you don't have to tolerate any kind of name-calling or hate speech. It is important to stand up for yourself and let the person know that their words are not acceptable. You can try to calmly explain why their language is offensive and why it is wrong to use it. If the person continues to use the language, you can walk away or report them to an authority figure. It is also important to talk to someone you trust about what happened and seek support.\"},\n",

       "  'human_answer': 'Some idiots might do',\n",
       "  'ai_answer': \"Yes, some women may get angry at their partners over cheating in their dream, as dreams can be reflective of real-life emotions. Dreams can be a way for the subconscious to process and make sense of difficult emotions, so it's possible for a woman to express her anger in her dream.\"},\n",

       "  'ai_answer': 'No, this is not a predator.'},\n",
       " {'question': 'Why is it people can go their whole lives doing good towards other people, being completely selfless and helping thousands of not millions of others along their journey, do one wrong thing, and suddenly everyone thinks they\\'re \"showing their true colors\"?',\n",
       "  'human_answer': 'Depends on how bad the one thing is. Also plenty of monsterous people do stuff like work with charities, donate money, etc just for the clout and good public image so that they will be less suspected or be judged less harshly.',\n",
       "  'ai_answer': \"People often make snap judgments and are quick to decide that a single wrong action defines a person's character. This can be especially true when someone has built up a reputation of doing good deeds and being selfless. When they make a mistake, it can feel like a betrayal, and people may be inclined to paint them in a negative light. However, it's important to remember that everyone makes mistakes, and that no one is defined by a single action.\"},\n",
       " {'question': 'What does ‘3 minutes to yesterday’ mean?',\n",
       "  'human_answer': 'I have never heard this before. Is it possible you misheard?',\n",
       "  'ai_answer': '\"3 minutes to yesterday\" is an expression that means that something that happened in the past is still very close in time, or that there is not much time that has passed since it happened. It can also be used to refer to something that is about to happen very soon.'},\n",

       "  'ai_answer': 'Males may take longer to poop because of their larger body size and slower metabolism. Additionally, men tend to eat more than women, and it takes longer for food to move through the digestive system. In some cases, constipation might also be a factor. Stress and anxiety can also cause digestive issues, leading to longer bathroom visits.'},\n",

       "  'ai_answer': 'There are a variety of reasons why drugs and crime may \"fall into your lap.\" It could be due to the people you associate with, the places you go, and the activities you participate in. If you are in an environment where drugs and crime are commonplace, you may be more likely to encounter them. Additionally, if you are engaging in risky behaviors or have a history of criminal activity, you may be more likely to be targeted by those who are involved in drug and criminal activities. It is important to remember that you have the power to make choices and create boundaries to protect yourself from any potentially dangerous situations.'}]"
