7,"I knew a guy who had a low level data/reporting job. He had several daily/weekly work responsibilities, including a bunch of reports that needed quite a bit of tweaking from raw data to finished product. But like I said, low level.

We didn't find out until way later, but he had set up macros for each of his major responsibilities where he could. Once set up, he'd just run the macros to do his work, but then he'd (smartly) hold off on delivering the reports until just a little before the deadlines. 

He'd hit every assignment and was seen as reliable. He also would complain about the workload so people would leave him with that work. I doubt he did a full hour of work a day after he set up what he did.

Eventually he left the job for one with better pay. But damn did he work lazy. Also, he was smart not to reveal until the end, because had he told them about it he would have gotten a pat on the back and would have been given a whole other workload, on top of maintaining those macros/etc. Dude milked the job, not the other way around.",1

70,"I want to start by saying that when I say Black Lives Matter- there is an implied “too” at the end. I am NOT saying my life matters more, or your life matters less. Just that mine is equally important and not viewed as such by unfortunately, many people. “All Lives Matter” is disrespectful because it negates the purposeful attention we are trying to draw to black injustice specifically. I need you to please understand that racism is not the racism they taught us in school anymore.

Modern racism is giving black people higher interest rates or bad loans (which a bank was sued millions for doing in 2017!). It’s relators purposely not showing black people houses in nicer areas. It’s companies only hiring 1-5 black people for their quota and not for their merit, which is ironically racist towards whites who potentially deserved it more- spurring more division. It’s colleges only accepting black people to make themselves look good on paper instead of actually valuing that students strengths & potential. It’s enforcing laws in school that don’t allow black people to wear their natural hair because it is “unprofessional” and a “distraction” to other students. It’s makeup companies only having 1-3 dark foundation shades because we are a “demographic” without money & thus not worth pursuing- and then suddenly coming out with more shades once they see how successful Rihanna was when she acknowledged us. It’s crooked police purposely going into low income areas, scanning license plates, and purposely ticketing people they know cannot afford it, so that they will go to jail for outstanding tickets and become a part of the for-profit prison pipeline. It’s fashion companies & movies using damaging stereotypes of black people instead of showing how diverse and beautiful our people are, thus instilling an untrue idea of what “black people” are to others across the world (imagine you’re from a place with no black people- if all the movies & shows portray us a certain way, you’ll assume that must be true).

When  I first started at my old place of employment, a very nice tech company, I had a black  janitor stop me one morning as I was heading up to the office, tears in  his eyes. He gripped my shoulder; his hands frail, wrinkled- and told me  how proud of me he was. How happy he was that a little black girl was  working at “one of them tech companies”. I hugged him & told him  thank you. When I tell you I ran to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out.  I was so grateful, but that is a heavy burden to carry- not only was I  working for me, I was working for him, for all my ancestors who didn’t  have a chance. And when I was let go 2 months ago, it hit hard because it felt like  not only did I fail me, I failed them. I realize it was not my fault, a  virus hit the country and I was a part of a mass layoff. But do you see  how race played into my emotional state, something most others wouldn’t  have to deal with?

So please, when you see Black Lives Matter, when you see protest, know that all we’re asking for is change. Yes we have civil rights, but why are you scoffing at us asking for more? Why are we expected to accept the bare minimum? As a kid (mind you I was born in 1996) I was given the talk that my skin means I have to conduct myself a certain way, in certain environments, for my own safety. That people will fear me for simply having too much melanin. That I will be black first, yourelovely second until I die. I am trying my hardest to create a future where I don’t have to give my kids that same speech, where I don’t have to pass down that generational trauma.

If you have questions about the protesting, the movement, modern racism- ask me please! I know it can be a heated topic and the only way to change that is to have an open dialogue and educate. This is me offering the olive branch, me saying I am hurting and still have nothing but love in my heart. Too often we are too busy trying to share our thoughts that we don’t hear others.

EDIT: I've gotten a lovely amount of responses- I'm in Boston & its currently 12:13 am, I'm trying to get a semi-regular sleep schedule on track so I'll probably be heading to bed soon, please know if I don't get back to you tonight I will tomorrow! All love & hugs from me, thank you for making a girl feel heard",1
71,"I rode my bike across the US.  Most of it solo.

In the middle of Missouri, I just ... had enough.  I stopped on some guys lawn and just cried.  He came out and asked me what was up and I explained how far I'd come (started in San Fransisco) and that I was just done.

He told me to ride into town (I think Springfield?) which was only 10 miles away and take a few days off and rest.  Which is what I did, because hey, one more day wouldn't matter, and the worst that would happen is that I'd pack it in and go home.

Well, a day of rest seemed to be exactly what I needed.  I spent a whole day (or most of it, anyway) in blessed air conditioning, ate all the food, drank all the water, and was more or less ready to go again.

I took a few more one-day breaks between Missouri and Williamsburg, VA which really helped me out.

72,"Welp I'm a Greek woman and I'm doing my masters in history, and have done a paper on the music about the fall of Constantinople. In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.

Edit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O
Edit no. 2: Actually no, guys, the paper wasn't on There might be giants! It was on Greek folk laments on the event of the fall, and how accurate were their lyrics in relation to the actual event.

93,"I used to work at a Boy Scout Summer Camp. Every week I had to take a big group of campers to a ""secluded"" spot for their wilderness survival badge where they had to build a shelter out of sticks, leaves, etc and sleep in it overnight. The spot was only about 1/2 mile from the main camp, but we took them a circuitous route that made it seem really secluded.

Anyways, on this one night all the campers had made their shelters, we had cooked dinner, and were all just sitting around the campfire. It was getting late, maybe 11:00, so I sent all the campers to their shelters for the night and started cleaning up the fire. That's when we heard in the distance what sounded like church bells. They were pretty faint, but myself and my fellow staffers could definitely hear them. They went on for about 30 minutes, ringing every 30 seconds, or so. We were all a little creeped out, as there were no churches or towns within 20 miles of us. After the bells stopped, though, the singing started. It was too faint to hear the words, but it sounded like church choir music, but **a lot** of people, and **a lot** more enthusiastic. Also, it was almost midnight at this point. The singing went on for well over an hour, sometimes quieting down until we almost couldn't hear it, sometimes getting so loud we thought it was getting closer.

All of the campers were super creeped out, but I lied to them, telling them there was a church service going on in camp, and that there was nothing to be scared of. Eventually, at almost 1 AM, the singing stopped. I found out a few days later that there had been a large KKK rally only a few miles away that night, and that's what we had heard.",1

If you're unhappy with your life now, you can adapt by changing. You need to believe that, and you probably know it since it seems to be something you're afraid of. But this is the real you now, and you need to focus on the needs of that person, not some idealized phantom from the past.",1
95,"I am 40 years old and I have three pieces of advice for anyone in their 20's

1. Accept that perfection doesn't exist. Your relationships will have problems, your car will break down, someone else will anyways have a better phone, a newer car, or a bigger house than you, no matter where on the social ladder you stand. Constantly chasing perfection will keep you permanently stressed. That doesn't mean you should not try to better your life, just know that if you expect perfection you will never be statisfied. 

2. Pay attention to your diet and health. I have been working out at least 4 times per week since my mid 20's. I am fitter, healthier and look younger than almost everyone else my age

3. Don't stop doing the things you love. Even though I have a wife, kids, job etc. I still make time to play video games, draw, write stories, read comics, play basketball, listen to music, etc. There is no reason to become a miserable old bastard!

EDIT: Wow! This has blown up way more than I expected. Thanks for the awards a guys. Its nice to know my advice can be useful to others.

EDIT 2: So, quite a few people have asked how I find time to fit in all these hobbies. As I said, I have to make the time. Apart from working out (which I do at 6am before everyone else wakes up) I'm not doing these things every day. I only game on the weekend if I get the chance, I read ebooks on my phone when I'm killing time in the day, I may buy a comic 2-3 times a year and I can usually find a few hours in the week to draw.

Carer burnout is a real issue and people need to know that it’s not easy to see someone you love struggling every day, or slowly fading away month by month. Carers and family members desperately need time for themselves and need to know that it’s okay to feel the way that they do. 

No one is superhuman and we all have our own needs. It’s why we have therapy groups for Carers. It’s okay to struggle to look after someone and you should in no way feel ashamed of having those feelings.

Edit, because this kinda blew up and I saw some mean comments about her: She was a good friend and they had been together for some years. 
They married young and it didn't occur to them that it would be strange if she went on the honeymoon and he stayed behind. He was a good guy and just wanted to see her happy and she really wanted to go on this vacation, because she had never left the country.

They seperated half a year after the wedding and my friend, the bride, told me, that the marriage had been a way to prolong the relationship despite both of them knowing that it was already over some time before they got married. Kinda like a couple gets a baby to save a marriage. It really was just sad because they were a nice couple, but they stayed friends after seperating.

And I can guarantee that she didn't cheated on him while away, they were both really loyal. 

About his sun allergy: he had red hair, a really fair skin and burned up within minutes. And I mean really bad sunburn, the kind you have to go to the hospital for. He always had to wear sunglasses, longarmed shirts and a hat, even on cloudy days, so the vacation was not for him.",1

Enforcing accountability in child support provided expenses just opens up the worst legal can of worms imaginable. 

edit: as for why I'd like to see it: I don't have any visibility into how my money gets spent and it irks me. Further more, my ex frequently rings up and asks for the next support payment early. Yes, often times there are valid reasons. So and so needed shoes. Fees for school trips. etc. But I also know she spends way above her means on a lot of fun, entertainment based discretionary things, then she realizes ""whups, can't buy groceries! tee hee! pleeeeeze?"". So she gets to be the ""fun"" parent. Welp kids, looks like we're going for long walks in the park again this weekend. Hooray for the library.

edit2: ok, 600 replies. Child support is contentious on Reddit. So far, the themes are:

- yes, its 2017, we should have the technology to implement this. Maybe some magic debit card or EBT style.
- no, current child support departments are bunged up enough, this would kill them.
- stop giving in to your ex - if she asks for money early in the future just ask what she needs specifically and buy it for her, then take that off the subsequent payment - GOOD idea!.
- people are petty.
- so put a law like this in motion. But to prevent abuse, the cost for an audit is borne by the parent who asked for it... or variations on that (I _like_ that idea.)

156,"Not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the US in the Depression.  It was called the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country.  The reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the Dust Bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the US was not a bottomless well of natural resources.  (Erosion was a big cause of the Dust Bowl, and the Dust Bowl was a factor in the Depression, so it all tied together.)  They were also called ""Roosevelt's Tree Army,"" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control.  

In my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture.  You can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive.  (I'm actually going to stay in one next week.)  Some of them have photos from the CCC days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on.  

I'd definitely support a program like that today, but I think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it.  Plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated.  With the CCC, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out.  It would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start.

Edit:  A number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins I mentioned.  The ones I'm familiar with are in Pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/.  Not all cabins are CCC-built, but ones listed as ""rustic"" often are--check individual park websites for details.  (There's usually a ""stay the night"" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a ""history"" page that will talk about CCC's role in the park.)  Rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a Pennsylvania resident.  The system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly.  Some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ADA-accessible unit.   

Other states and some national parks also have CCC-built cabins available for rental, but as far as I know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are.",1

We were signing the contract for the event and I kept thinking that it was quite remote, so I asked: ""how much time does it take for the ambulance to get here?"" 

I became the laughing stock of both families. My (then future) mother in law, who was present at the meeting, literally fell down from the chair laughing. The wedding organizer, remembered it for weeks, telling about it everyone we met. My dad, ended every sentence with ""...but maybe you need an ambulance for that"". My wife was making siren noises, when I was saying something we disagreed on. Every family dinner all the aunts and uncles were ""checking"" if the ambulance was present. You name it. The entire package.

Still I couldn't get rid of this weird feeling. It would have taken over an hour for the ambulance to get to the garden. After a few weeks I ended up paying a private ambulance to be present at the wedding.

Fast forward to the ceremony. As my wife literally walks down the aisle, at the back of the garden I see two Paramedics running with a stretcher and my dad squeezing my hand whispering: ""that's not of your god damn business, let them to take care of it. ""

What happened was that one of our older guests got a heart attack and almost died at ceremony. Was saved by the private ambulance.

Ever since then, when my wife tells me that I'm overthinking, I just do the siren noise.

He and several of the guys randomly broke out into a push-up contest. Again. White collar office. Middle-aged dudes in khakis.

Couldn’t remember the nationality of our Hispanic colleague. Tried to “learn Spanish” to make her feel special when she returned from maternity leave. (1) What he learned was NOT Spanish, and (2) she was from Portugal. She knew like, five words of Spanish.

Disappeared for four days. No call. No email. Wouldn’t respond to any of our attempts to reach him. Finally, someone drove out to his house to make sure he was alive. He was. He’d just forgotten to tell us he was taking the week off, and then lost his phone in a lake.

There were many, many moments like these. Great boss. Genuinely cared about everyone in the company. Occasional moments of brilliance, where he really got things done. But OMG, so many moments of ridiculousness.",1

I have worked at an airport and have spoken to a security officer who helped a woman stop being transported and killed. 

The woman did not know she wasn’t going to be coming home, until she got to the airport and her husband went to the toilet and she realised only he had a return ticket. 
She somehow managed to quickly think to hide her bangle so that she could set the metal detector off and have to be searched. As the officer was up close and searching her, the woman whispered “help me”. The officer quickly took her for a private search, grabbed the woman’s bags and passport too ‘as protocol’ and went into the private search room. The woman fell on the floor crying, begging for help, so they called the police. The husband started to get suspicious and tried to break his way into the room and the officer had to push against the door, thankfully the police turned up straight away and restrained him. He was arrested and she was given protection and moved to a new city to start a new life. It was harrowing to hear, and really awful to know that this goes on! 

If you have any suspicion of something like this happening, even an inkling, please do something, call someone. ",1
219,"In elementary school, there was a pencil machine in the front lobby where you could get pencils for 25 cents. There were also ""special"" pencils that had stars on them. If you got one of these special pencils, you could take it into the office and get a prize.

One day, I decided to get a pencil. I put in my quarter and out popped TWO pencils. And one of them was a special pencil! I went into the office and told the lady at the desk that the machine gave me two pencils and one of them was special. She proceeded to say that the machine shouldn't do that, took the special pencil, and didn't give me a prize. That was 19 years ago and I'm still pissed.

\*Edit to answer some of the more common questions:

* The prizes were stuff like the fancy erasers that didn't actually erase anything, fun size candy bars, stuff like that. Think 5-10 tickets at Chuck E Cheese's.
* I probably didn't go to school with you. This happened in Michigan. Apparently the pencil machines are a common thing.
* This happened in either 2nd or 3rd grade, so the time was probably closer to 20-21 years ago (Fuck, that makes me feel old...)

We’d require mum and partner to both get covid tests done in our clinic the day before the planned admission so we knew which ward to place them in.

One patient refused to have the swab taken because she thought covid was a hoax. So we were told her she’d have to stay in the red ward during her admission as we couldn’t confirm she didn’t have covid if she didn’t have a test.

239,"I used to be into amateur radio after a short stint in the army cadets. There was one guy, in the east Midlands, UK, who was one of the adult instructors. He was always telling us about amateur radio, and would hand out old/cheaper pieces of tech he'd tried out and wasn't keeping.

Anyway, he was a little weird, overly friendly (with adults, never had any bad vibes around the kids) and obviously had some social anxiety which he was compensating for, personally I suspect he was on the autistic spectrum, but who knows. After I left the cadets and went to Uni, I stayed in touch on Facebook. We were in the same Facebook group for amateur radio hobbyists.

He always liked to do things by the book, and instilled in us the importance of being responsible and socially conscious with our radio use. He was the same on Facebook, reminding people that Mrs Miggins on her £10 handset wouldn't know about transmission power, and squelch, etc. He mentioned in passing to a new member the importance of only using the public unlicensed channels (kind of like CB Radio in the US) on the correct, very low, power setting of half a watt. He mentioned it was because Mrs Miggins trying to reach her kid in the next street wouldn't understand the idea that she could hear you but couldn't reach you to ask you to be quiet a minute. He was correct here, and it's also a criminal offence to transmit at higher power on these frequencies, even though its not enforced. 

Anyway, this got someone's back up, and he was kicked from the group for ""preaching"".

After unsuccessfully asking to be let back in, he set up a larger antenna in his back garden, set up a super fancy aerial atop it, with a 30 Watt transmission system... (this is really quite powerful) 

He now turns this on for several hours a day on whatever channels the radio club/group are using to 'teach them the importance of good etiquette'. This means that nobody can use certain frequencies for hours at a time, as it just sounds like someone is having a one way conversation on air.

He could probably get arrested, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all.",1

So the current pause isn't unprecedented, but still rare. Once it gets to 46 hours it will be a first during the presidency.

Edit: I exported everything since 01-01-2017 from [here](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive), hassled a bit with the U.S. date and time format and then did a simple subtraction between each subsequent tweet time.

Edit2: 27 hours so far, which leaves 21 cases where at least this long has passed between 2 tweets since the beginning of 2017. In 6 more hours (33 hours since the last tweet), this will be down to 6 cases over the same time period - 33,7 hours, 34 hours, 37,3 hours, 38,5 hours, 40,3 hours and 45,9 hours. This should probably cover the interesting information.

Edit3: The president has returned: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1109787378242240514 The final count was 39 hours 46 minutes, which makes this the 3rd largest gap between tweets during this presidency.

Her medical history had extensive complaints of abdominal pains, one Dr even referred to her as a ""hypochondriac"" and others commented on apparent anxiety. Opened her abdomen and she had extensive scar tissue, she was absolutely massacred inside from endometriosis. She suffered for decades and never got referred for a laparoscopy. 

She didn't have fucking anxiety, she had a medical condition.

EDIT: a few clarifications. Patient cause of death was unrelated. I won't give any details because it may get too identifying. I am UK based and this was an NHS post mortem. Patient did not have diagnosed anxiety. Drs referred to her anxiety only in relation to her abdominal pain complaints, no other known history.

There was a man at my door who introduced himself as the husband of a woman who my husband worked with. He was there to tell me that my husband and his wife were having an affair. He had busted them about six months prior and had told his wife that she had to end the affair. He thinks that she did end it...for about three months, but then they started up again. When he found out they were at it again, he called my husband (because he knew if he confronted him in person, he'd be in a jail cell for what he'd have done). On the phone, he told my husband to leave his wife alone or else he would come and tell me everything that was happening. Apparently, my husband thought that he was bluffing.

332,"Regression.

I’m a speech therapist who works in an inner city elementary children where we see a lot of poverty, drug abuse, etc. I had one case stand out to me in particular that stands out. 

I saw a little girl, 7 years old, who had been delayed on her language skills. We knew she had a very difficult upbringing since she was the product of a rape. She lived only with her mother who impressively kept the two events (the rape and the birth of her daughter) as separated as possible. The rapist (who I refuse to call a father) had served time in jail but was released at this point on house arrest. He had no rights to see her. But the rapist’s parents, technically the child’s grandparents, went to court and  demanded rights to see their “granddaughter”. They refused to ever believe their son was a rapist. Some judge, who I hope thinks of this case often, allowed it as long as father was not present. It started as supervised visits and eventually turned into visitation without supervision. Mom fought as hard as she could, but she couldn’t afford a lawyer like the grandparents could. Mom had to drop her daughter off to the parents of her rapist every other weekend for one night. I don’t know how she did it.

Anyways, I started to see a huge regression in her language skills. Her mean length of utterance decreased, she couldn’t logically organize her thoughts into sentences, she couldn’t categorize anymore and so forth. Academically when I spoke to the teacher she said the same thing. But it really came to a head when she started to regress in other, non-school related skills. 
One day she wet her pants in my classroom. And she just lost it. She was crying, she destroyed my room, she was hitting and punching to the point where I had to restrain her from hurting herself. She just lost it. Finally when she calmed down, I brought her down to the nurse, got her a change of pants. But this was a girl was not only potty trained since Id known her, but she was known for being sweet, polite and just slow to warm up. She was NOT a child to have outbursts like this. She wasn’t sick. And I felt like I really needed to say something outside the school.

Long story short, grandparents were sneaking over to fathers house so that her “father could see and help raise his daughter”. Turns out he started inappropriately touching her in the bathroom, during tub time, at the kitchen table, watching TV. Basically any chance he could when the grandparents walked out the room for any amount of time.

My heart broke for the mom. I’ll never forget her telling us about how she couldn’t live with herself knowing the fact that the man who raped her, also touched her daughter. Anyways, you can probably imagine all the hurt and heartbreak the mother felt.",1

As soon as he heard that and the police leaving he tore down the wall (hed already been working on this apparently) and robbed the place taking his sweet time. Escaped without anyone noticing anything for hours, until the jewellers came back in the morning. 
Then he tried to re-sell something he stole which had a serial number on it and got caught. So not that smart after all. Good effort though.

The online threats were funny, but when I started getting death threats by mail I backed the fuck off.

edit: I didn't think this would blow up like it did, but to answer a few common questions,

- I posted a bunch or criticism of the CoS in the Usenet group alt.religion.scientology. This was in the late '90s and well before most modern forums and content aggregators like Reddit existed (Fark was the big one and Digg was just starting to get popular).

-I was high school (for non Americans, grades 9-12)

-I was in high school and was using my home computer as an FTP server for a Warez group on IRC because I convinced my dad to sign up for a 90 day free trial of this new thing called ""broadband."" I had 3 Mbps down and 1.5 Mbps up. Of course we never cancelled it.

-They figured out who I was by using a CuteFTP vulnerability to get root directory access to my PC. The death threats were bad enough, but what really sticks with me is the malice of deleting my family photos including the last picture is us with my dad whole he was alive.

-I was the typical invincible-feeling young adult and I was more concerned about worrying my mom than I was about my own safety.

-This was long before ""doxxing"" was a thing, and online threats going from email to handwritten letters was terrifying, but as a high school kid I never would have admitted it.

-Nobody asked, but if I was confronted in person I would have fought back. 18 years later, if they really held a grudge and threatened me again with the same malice expressed in those letters I got, I would open the door with a gun in hand and if they tried to get in, I would assume that they were intending to kill me and shoot first.

-This is a serious post so as funny as it would be to accept the previous statement with the autocomplete error ""shit first,"" I fixed it.",1

I could smell it when I pulled up.

the mobile home was new and had only been set up for about 8 months. while setting it up, someone didn't tighten a no-hub band of the toilet in the kids bathroom.

8 months of flushed toilet was all over the ground, under the home and had just started being noticed outside.

* All those times you just accepted things that were girly without ever attracting any kind of attention to it really went a long way towards helping me build a healthy perception of guys. You never expressed any kind of disdain or machismo when I asked for your help untangling my Barbie's hair or prodding you with magic fairy wands. 

* You never hesitated to teach me practical skills - and you never attributed gender to them. It was always, ""Come over here and let me show you how to snake the drain, because you're going to need to do this."" BTW dad, I snaked my first drain all on my own last month! I'm so glad you taught me.

* Thank you for bailing me out when I was in a pinch, no questions asked. No guilting, no attempts at squeezing out information. I felt like I could come to you with any dilemma. This took a load of my shoulders because Mom is so reactive and ""freak out first, maybe resolve later."" 

* You respect me, which makes me respect you even more. When I call you out on BS, you actually repent and reflect. You don't deflect back on me and pull the, ""I'm the parent and know better than you"" spiel. 

* You actually took the time to sit and watch my cartoons or (attempt) to understand my video games or other hobbies. Mom always turned up her nose. You didn't. Do you know how awesome it is to watch your Dad actually laugh at the cartoon your mother just dismissed as ""dumb"" minutes before? So gratifying.

* All those times you went shopping for groceries and picked up ladies sanitary supplies without any hesitation, even if you did affectionately rename the long super maxi pads, ""low-salt maxis.""

* Thank you for all those secret times you let me pick something out of the vending machine to eat when we were on trips together - you knew Mom would never allow it.

* You take great pride in ""embarrassing me"" - but you know exactly where to draw the line so it's endearingly goofy, not genuinely embarrassing. You know your audience and play to it. I feel no shame when my friends (or now-fiance) are around you.

* It's okay if your hands were too callused to properly tie my ballet skirt before classes. I could tie it myself. But I didn't tell you at the time because I knew it made you happy to help me. So don't be embarrassed because the fabric kept snagging on your calluses.

* I wish you took your dental hygiene more seriously. I think your lax attitude and seeing you lose a lot of your teeth didn't set the best example for my sister while we were growing up.

**EDIT - did not expect Gold, yikes!** I realize closing with a comment about my Dad's flossing habits is kind of lame but it was stream of consciousness.

The worst I’ve seen (just garbage, not counting stuff brought to the hazmat department):

- a freezer stuffed with a skinned, rotting, headless deer carcass. We nearly called the cops before we realized it wasn’t human.

- Used needles. The worst being a tie between “porcupine couch” and the lady who literally handed me a *paper bag* full of syringes she found during a park cleanup.

- large container of old crystallized picric acid. Bomb squad had to deal with that one.

The best:

- a high end laptop in perfect condition except for a tiny crack on the lcd panel. Easy DIY repair that took $40 and 5 minutes, thing would’ve cost $1.5K new

- enough brand new furniture to literally furnish my whole apartment 

- a high end military grade inflatable boat, brand new 

The weirdest:

- a 1st gen platelet counting machine, complete with weird tubes of bright green liquid and mercury. When I was prepping it for hazmat disposal I had to call the company that bought the company that made it for some info... they never digitized the records but the oldest repair tech still working was super excited because he remembered servicing them 50 years ago.

- coffin. No body, just the coffin. Couldn’t see anything wrong with it either.

- buckets of testicles (from a ranch) that had been sitting out in the summer heat for a week. Smelled so bad my coworker hurled. That’s not the weird part... the weird part is the guys *wanted their buckets back.* Do you know how bad it has to smell to make a garbage collector puke? And they wanted them back?!

- the $10k duffel bag. Lady came in super upset because earlier she threw out a duffel bag that she didn’t know her boyfriend kept cash in. Over $10,000 in cash. We never found the bag.

- 16 full size barrels of old vegetable grease some guy had saved up in his garage. He was planning to make a biodiesel car or something.

Edit: a lot of people are asking if we get to keep stuff. Officially, no. It’s not against the law as far as I know (except for illegal stuff like drugs), but it’s against our policy. However workers do salvage things... as long as it’s discreet and they’re not selling it, management doesn’t get involved. Selling stuff is a big no.

We don’t fight over stuff. In fact we’ll keep an eye out for things colleagues might need. Most of what we salvage is actually tools and stuff we use at the dump. I’ve also started a management approved program to give away free household products that would otherwise be hazardous waste (paint, oil, cleaners, etc).

483,"Its worth noting that in the US, this has been tried/proposed several times in several jurisdictions and courts toss it out.  This is a *massive* simplification (bc the full explanation is super complicated), but in the US punishments must be clearly delineated (eg not arbitrary) in the statute and based on the crime itself, not on the perpetrator her/himself.  And to be clear - a judge has discretion to waive/reduce/etc due to hardship, but it really doesn't work the other way (eg, a judge can give you the 'max' but s/he can't just arbitrarily tack on a punishment higher that the statute permits b/c you are rich.)

EDIT to add: getting way too many replies to answer ppl, but here is something to think about: The 8th amendment plus the 14th amendment together prohibit punishments that are 'arbitrary.'  This means that when you are punished for a crime, there has to be a set penalty in place. This means that if two people commit the *exact* same crime under the *exact* same circumstance in the *exact* same jurisdiction, they would get the *exact* same punishment.  If a punishment was based on your income, you'd get two different outcomes - this is why these laws get tossed.  There's a famous quote I'm butchering that goes something like 'justice can never be served by the roll of the dice,' meaning different outcome for different people in identical situations isn't justice.

Another thing to consider - your income itself is *also* arbitrary.  On monday you're unemployed; the next day you take your last dollar and win the lottery; if you got a ticket monday, the punishment is $0 on tuesday your punishment is $$$$$ - with no change in the law itself; that's too arbitrary in the eyes of the law.  There are also several other challenges in the way of income-based fines, but the 8th plus 14th amendments are the big ones.

Final edit: there's a ton of ""but in Germany..."" or ""but in finland...""  or ""if it works in Europe, it can work here."" Other countries can do whatever they want; in the US we are bound by the US Constitution - there's not a lot of wiggle room short of 1) passing an amendment, or 2) pushing through a whole new interpretation of several amendments and getting a whole shit load of precedent reversed.  Good luck with that.",1

I like it because the dark gray metallic color matches my laptop and the aluminium material feels way sturdier than a plastic stand would. I chose a very slim model that's basically just a framework for the laptop, no table or anything, because I mainly need this to take up the least possible space in my backpack as I travel with it every day.

- breath in and out so deeply you feel like your ribs are being pulled apart and knitted back together. 

- Grab something near you, could be a pole, table whatever, and clench and unclench around it. 

- Walk, while counting your steps. 

- Do something rhythmic, I like bouncing a ball personally but can be anything, from using a stamp to skipping.

524,"Chef Boyardee beefaroni. One summer, because I was hella bored, I bought some chef Boyardee beefaroni and put it in my friend's mailbox as a prank. He didn't find it but his parents did, and they asked their neighbors who did it. He suspected me at first, but I managed to get him off of my tail. Now our neighborhoods were fairly close to eachother, so I could be over there in a 50 minute walk. Every night, I walked up to their neighborhood (walking anywhere at 2:am is creepy as hell but the Boyardee bandit does not stop for demons) and put a can of beefaroni inside their mailbox. After about a month, they call the police to find out who's putting beefaroni in their mailbox. Luckily the police really didn't care that much and just told them to get a camera which they eventually did. Meanwhile my friend is telling me all of this from his perspective, right, so I usually know what they do before I strike. So I start covering my face, and pretend to hunch over. I have no idea where this camera is, so I can never be too careful. They call the cops again and give them a profile, and now the cops are looking for a crippled beefaroni bandit. After a solid 3 months of this shit, one of the baggers at the store gets word somehow, and starts getting suspicious because he sees me buying tons of beefaroni. He confronts me, I tell him the truth, and I shit you not he starts helping me beefaroni my friend's house. We're putting it all over hiding it in the lawns, porch, fence, you name it. Halloween rolls around, and I dress up as chef Boyardee. I go to my friends house and say ""your daily subscription to Chef Boyardee beefaroni has ended. Would you like to renew?"". I hear laughter in the background, and it's the store clerk. Turns out he recently started dating best friend's sister, and that's how he heard. Truth be told, I don't think I've ever been punched harder than when my friend found out. Good times. We still laugh about it from time to time.

TLDR. Bought and hid chef Boyardee beefaroni for nearly half a year around my best friend's house. The Beefaroni bandit strikes again!",1
525,"My story is a bit different. I was coaching a soccer team and had a kid in the foster program on the team. He was 13. Over the course of the season my wife and I really got to know him and saw how shitty his foster parents were. At the end of the season we asked him if he wanted to come live with us instead. It’s been 9 years since then. 

We had rough patches, but for us it was easy. We were still a young couple (24 & 27) then but his social worker arranged continued funding for us which eliminated any financial burden. It was an easy decision for us and I’d do it again in a heart beat. We’ve had 4 of his other biological siblings live with us at one time or another as they’ve aged out of foster care. They all have their own unique problems, but all kids do. His 18 year old sister asked to come quarantine with us so we’ve got her staying here now. His brothers and sister are all just extra family and our biological little ones (3 & 5) call them all brother/sister. 

He’s 22 now and almost done with college and hopes to be a police officer. Sadly my wife and I will be moving out of state soon and we’ll miss him like crazy, but know we’ve prepared him for life outside our home. We’ll still be there for him of course, but we’re excited to see him thrive independently. His girl friend of 4 years is pushing him to move to our new state once they both finish school so they may still be back near us soon enough.",1

When I first watched LOTR, I couldn't have cared less when Boromir died. He was arrogant, not as cool as anyone else, and dangerously drawn to the ring.

However, as I've gotten older, I find myself connecting with Boromir more with every watch. He clearly cares deeply for the other members of the fellowship. Unfortunately, he also feels the weight of responsibility for his people, and the pressure from his father. The ring fed into that tortuous quandry, and nearly drove him mad.

The scene where he comes to his senses after driving Frodo off is heartbreaking now. So, so horrified at what he'd done. So vulnerable, so human. And despite believing that he had doomed the world, he threw himself into protecting that which he could still reach, the other hobbits. Everything he had, including his life. And his last moments with Aragorn, oof. The love and pride that bursts from him.

While working there I had a very polite customer, who was pregnant at the time, come in every other week or so and order the same footlong ham sandwich. What made this sandwich so strange was that she would ask for a tonne of black olives. Like MULTIPLE, whole handfuls of black olives. So much, that it was hard to close up and wrap the sandwich without some olives spilling out. 

Some of my coworkers would only give her so much before they refused to add more. There were no rules, to my knowledge, stating a limit on the amount of black olives a customer could request, so I always obliged. Knowing this, she would refuse help from my coworkers and wait for me to make her footlong black olive sandwich. She would always comment that it was something she started ordering after becoming pregnant and it was the baby that wanted the olives. 

Some time had passed where I didn’t see her come in anymore. Until one day, I see her walk in with a stroller and her brand new baby daughter. She brought her in so I could meet the “olive baby”.

598,"I kept having this kid come and sleep in the 1st period. I mean that’s normal for high school. One day I made pancakes as a treat and the kid didn’t sleep, they ended up staying up and ate 6 pancakes. 
Later the kid told me they often don’t eat breakfast because their parents don’t buy food. When they have extra money it goes to buying alcohol. After hearing that I went and bought Breakfast foods and left them out for anyone to take. The kid didn’t sleep after that.

Edit: I didn’t think this would blow up. But I wanted to clarify, the parents didn’t qualify for food stamps or any help because they made too much money. At least it looked like they did on paper but really they didn’t. I lived in the Bay Area  at the time and even though they made a lot, most the money went to rent it living expenses. They also generally seemed to make bad choices, not judging them but it seemed kids came last often.
I think one thing that came from the pandemic that is good is the free food that many schools are handing out. It’s wonderful to see. In the past our district would still offer meals in the summer to any kid under 18 who showed up to summer school even if not attending.

Continued: someone mentioned these parents should be judged. I agree they sound horrible. But one thing I keep in mind when working with kids is trauma is multi generational. We don’t know what impacted these  parents to behave this way. 
Personally, my mother grew up very poor and in abusive home. Her parents had gone through the Holocaust and it really impacted them. They didn’t know how to be parents and struggled with mental health issues in a time that didn’t  really provide support/ had negative stigma of mental health. So this trauma was passed on to my mom. My mom was a good mom but wasn’t always there for us emotionally because of her own attachment style she developed from her parents. So the trauma was passed on to us. 
Now that I am a parent I have to work super hard not to pass on the negative things I learned from my parents but changing behavior can be hard. 
I am not making an excuse for this kids parents. Something I learned while studying psychology ( my BA is psychology) is trauma passes through generations. 
I had a teacher once say something I always keep in mind when working with students: kids can impact and change parents behavior. Parents behavior and personality can change because of the child as well. Not saying this kid lead the parents to drink but rather having a kid who has special needs, doesn’t bond with you the way you wanted  or doesn’t behave how you expected them to can really impact you as a person.

Edit 2: yes I reported these parents. I called cps on them several times. I reported this to school admin, I talked to the school psych about this, I gently talked to the parents about this as well. Judging a parent isn’t helpful, but helping and educating a parent is what is needed. If the system fails we can only do so much. So if it takes spending $6 bucks on a bag of pancake mix every month I can do that. Sometimes we have to have short term goals to meet before we can fix the long term ones. So if just giving the kid food when hungry helps I will do it while we work on fixing the bigger issue. 
When I started to feed the kids breakfast I partly did it with this one kid in mind but I realized it wasn’t just this kid who came to school hungry. Teens have sleeping issues and sometimes they don’t get up early enough for breakfast. Some people can’t sleep till 3 am, some kids have horrible anxiety and they are up all night and can’t sleep, heck I bet a lot of those kids I worked with where simply not morning people and getting up to go to school sucked for them. I saw kids who came from good homes come to school hungry because something other than neglect caused it (though in this case it was neglect don’t get me wrong). 
All I am saying is we can’t judge a parent, we sometimes have to find a fast solution while fixing the bigger picture.",1

Well, of course, some of my classmates got their hands on a complete set of tests from the previous year. Soon, everyone had a set. Before each exam, we would sit together and make sure we knew how to solve every problem on that test so we could do it on the real exam with different numbers. 

Years later, when I became a teacher myself, I saw Mr D at a funeral. I confessed to him that this is what we used to do. He smirked and said “Who do you think leaked the test packet to get you to study?” Mr D had figured out that kids won’t study if the teacher suggests it, but if they think they’re getting away with something, they totally will, so he managed to get a test packet out and circulating as contraband.

I went to a very large university with great amenities, so I didn’t need the membership during the school year.  I tried to cancel at the end of one summer.  I was at the gym one day and I asked about cancellation.  I was told to come back at a certain time frame the following Wednesday to cancel.  I complied.  When I showed up the “person doing the cancellations wasn’t there.”  I was told to return the following Wednesday.  Surprise, surprise, the person wasn’t there again.  I told them I was going to stop the payment through the credit card company.  They responded by telling me that they’d take me to collections then.  I ended up escalating through their corporate offices to get the membership cancelled.  They managed to get 2 extra months of fees out of me.  After that year of college, I shifted over to LA Fitness, and maintained that membership for about 10 years.  When I moved away from LA Fitness, I joined the YMCA, where I’ve been for the last 5-6 years.  I will always have a gym membership, but I am committed to not joining a Lifetime Fitness again until am reimbursed.  It’s really a loss for both of us.

I notice there's a taped off spot on the bridge right before mcdonalds with a crane, cops and an ambulance.

He was always pretty odd, but he was nice enough. Plus we had a few classes together thru middle school and we had connected over a shared love of a few videogames, so I felt comfortable asking him why he started wearing it all of the sudden. 

He proceeded to explain the defensive benefits of chain mail vs. both sharp and blunt instruments of harm. For like 5 solid minutes. Daggers. Pikes. Hammers. Even how curved blades like katana and falchions would struggle against it! 

I basically just shrugged and told him ""I mean, makes sense."" And we both went to our classes. 

I don't know what I expected, but I guess it wasn't the basic defensive benefits that armor offers.

Edit: Wow, thank you all! This is a much more widespread phenomenon than I had thought! This all took place in Wyoming (before it ceased being) for all the people wondering if it was their own knightly scholar.

Edit 2: I believe he wore an undershirt, then armor and then an over shirt. The armor was about 55lbs (I think) and it had a full hood (widows peak and all) and sleeves. This was in the 2000's so school shootings were definitely a thing, but not quite a weekly event, yet (yay America!). Also, I'm not gonna say his name, like I said, he was always nice and I'm not about to dox an old homie. Plus Wyoming has like 35 people in it, so... yeah...

I also was not trying to shame him at all, I think it was way cool and creative. Like the thread may suggest, a little weird, but I absolutely applaud the ingenuity to craft it all himself, so I don't want anyone who reads this to think I was shaming or bullying.

If you want to make chainmail for school or work or church or whatever, hell yeah, lil homie, be your own beautiful self! All love on this end!",1

[Why is the large bread cheaper than the small bread in Houston?](https://imgur.com/a/BmybA)

It's the exact same bread.  Same ingredients, same taste, same size slices, everything.  The **only** differences are:

- The ""Large"" is longer (more slices).

- The ""Large"" is less expensive.

That's it.

This is the case in every grocery store I've seen in Houston: Kroger, Randall's, Target, even Wal-Mart.  The small bread is always more expensive and has been for years.

There is no conceivable reason anyone should be buying the small bread here.  Even if you kept your bread in an oddly short bread basket, it would be cheaper to just buy the large loaf and throw out a few slices.

And don't say it's something about scale.  That doesn't add up.  If it was cheaper to produce the large loafs, then they'd stop producing the small loaves.  It's the exact same bread.

**The.  Exact.  Same.  Bread.**

He's supposed to have the money to pay everything before December 30th.

When he goes to pay, he'll find out it's already paid. 

Best part is he gets to believe, for a week, all he's got from me is a pair of socks.

Edit: Wow! I didn't expect this reaction. Thanks everyone for the awesome comments and for the awards. This community is truly amazing! 

I thought I'd provide more information here to try and answer some of the questions :)

We live in Brazil and he's going to the UK for a year and a half. 

He'll be taking his masters there for a year and a half. This has been a goal of his for a while and, according to him, will help him get a good job in a larger company in one of the capitals. We live in a small town, not a lot of options for someone in his line of work.

As to why he's been saving for a whole year, we're in Brazil. Exchange rate is 1 GBP to 5.47 BRL. That alone is quite the challenge. 

He's been saving for tuition + accommodation for the first two months and is paying through a local travel agency. The owner is a close personal friend, so I'm not very worried about him paying twice.

To everyone worried about the car, he was going to sell it anyways. It doesn't make any sense to keep it stored for a year. Cars are quite expensive in Brazil, so yeah, he was going to use the money towards the trip. Now he can use it to explore.

Oh, and I'll post an update here once he finds out :)

Edit: UPDATE

So he got the socks! He has until the 30th to pay for the course so he hasn't found out yet but he did his best to look happy with the socks 😂😂 It was pretty clear he was disappointed though!

I will need to travel back home tomorrow so I won't be around to actually see his face when he finds out. But I am sure he's gonna call / text so I'll post an update with the reaction :)

Edit: UPDATE

He found out!! And as promised here's an update on the reaction.

He called me and he was crying :) He said he called our father to ask if he could borrow a couple grand to be able to make the payment today and my dad told him it had been paid already. He couldn't believe it.

He kept saying thank you and that he hopes some day he can pay the gesture back. I told him he more than did already. He was there for me everytime I needed. He went out of his way to pull me out of the gutter when I was down. I was always able to rely on him. 

He cried. I cried. 

We talked about the UK, about his plans for the future and decided that, now that he has spare money to explore Europe, we'll take a trip together next summer.

I wish I had been there when he found out.

[**Kenshi**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/)

I am not kidding - this game took twelve years to make and was finally released a couple of weeks ago.

The map is the size of the Isle of Wight.

It's a *real* sandbox, and you can play whatever kind of game you want to play in it.

Farm cactus and make rum. Set up a world-class weapon production house. Make and sell clothing. Or hashish. Or bandanas. Build a town. Roam around with your band of tame goats. Fight the holy empire. Free the slaves. Buy the slaves. Capture people and sell them as slaves. Journey through the most imaginative and gorgeous terrain I've ever seen.

I have well over 900 hours in it. It's a fucking masterpiece.

Bonus trivia: There are some places in the swamps where you'll run across guys in villages selling drugs and fish, the two most common local products. It's the only game I've ever seen where walking past an NPC can prompt them to call out

**""High on drugs? Buy some delicious fish!""**

***Edited to add:*** *There's this thing called Early Access and beta versions, for anyone else who thinks I might be pretending that I've played 900 hours of a game in the last two weeks.*

Final edit: apologies if I didn't get around to answering your question - I'm sorry, there were hundreds and I had to turn off inbox replies because a surprising amount of people haven't heard of Early Access and/or are *super* upset that I really like this game. Sometimes blocking ain't enough. The game's great, check some of the fantastic replies that others have left on it, there's some good humans in this thread. Party on, dudes.",1
806,"Yes. I have had this happen in a venue I managed in Melbourne. 

The lady in question became very forward, slightly abusive and threatening. The gentleman was obviously concerned for himself and did not like the way the date had progressed, we booked him a taxi and walked him out a back exit whilst he was going to he toilet. I spoke to the lady and covered his half of the bill. She became hysterical, paid and then left. 

There was a huge power imbalance.

815,"I voted Leave during the referendum, and whilst I stand by my reasons for this initial vote, I came to change my view over the course of the absolute nightmare that has been Brexit.

When I voted, it was primarily because of the federalisation of the EU. I am not opposed to this in principle, but I have never been very convinced by how the European government is structured. In particular I was concerned that the European Parliament votes on legislation and cannot *propose* new legislation; they can only debate and amend legislation put forth to them by the European Commission. I believed, and still believe, that there is a fundamental democratic deficit in the European Union and that full integration into a supranational quasi-federation would not be desirable whilst such a deficit exists.

(I feel that the EU *needs* to either fully federalise  or draw back into a looser confederation. The half-and-half state it currently in does not feel robust or stable enough to be properly efficacious)

I was very torn when it came time to vote. I have never considered myself ""european"", and as stated above I had a lot of reservations about the EU; but I also recognised the advantages of membership. At the time I believed that federalisation was inevitable if the EU was to survive and so long as major reforms were not put in place - reforms I had despaired of ever occurring - then I felt the UK would be drawn into what would in essence be a federal oligarchy.

When I voted, I made a number of erroneous assumptions about how the Brexit process would unfold which tipped my hand in favour of Leave and which did not come to pass:

1) The Conservative party is self-serving and cruel, but they're not insane

2) Brexit is by nature a political poisoned chalice because of the strong opinions on both sides; Europe has always been a divisive issue and the government must understand this.

3) Because of 2, a bipartisan commission or committee would be established to negotiate Brexit. This would allow the Tories to have their cake and eat it. Setbacks could be blamed on Labour/EU and their own involvement downplayed whilst successes and positive outcomes could be bigged-up since it was still their sitting government ""delivering the will of the electorate"".

4) Even if the Tories did decide to go it alone in the negotiations, they wouldn't be *utterly* incompetent, surely.

5) An election is probably right around the corner because of this mess; maybe we can get a Labour government, or a Labour-led coalition who I believe would negotiate somewhat more competently than a Conservative one.

6) The Leave vote probably won't win anyway, because it seems like everyone is in favour of the EU, or at least willing to look past its flaws.

7) There will be a deal. We will negotiate a deal; it might not please everyone and it might take quite a lot of negotiating, but the PM isn't going to try to ram one particular version of it down Parliament's throats three or four times with little to no amendment or negotiation because that would be stupid.

Whilst I stand by my criticisms of the EU, if there had been a second referendum I would have voted Remain.",1

831,"I had an interview where I knew the answers I gave were good, solid examples. I understood the technical side well. But the interviewer kept sneering, being rude and saying “really?” In a skeptical tone and I got the distinct impression he hated me. About 20 mins in, I thought about politely calling it a day and leaving but in my innocence thought it would be good practice to stay. 40 mins in, it’s like a light switch goes off inside and he’s the nicest guy, his eyes light up and he started hard selling the role and position to me. Introduces me to the team. The director interviews me and he and the team are lovely. Apparently, their interview technique is to be rude to see how you perform under pressure and they’d all been observing using a camera and were impressed I remained so polite and calm throughout. They couldn’t understand why I declined.

EDIT: to save me responding to comments. I understand pressure testing is a legitimate technique, and whilst I felt deeply uncomfortable and my gut was screaming at me to get out of there like in a nightclub when you know the creepy guy is really bad news and you need to get out, I understood that it was a possibility that that is what he could have been doing.

However to add more context, they had my work history including 10 years in the ambulance services which involves resuscitation whilst the public yell at you and threaten you. I’m used to being polite and professional whilst being harassed and threatened. 

Nothing spreadsheet based, even pulling all nighters is going to match that for pressure and I’m well known for staying calm and composed all the time (even if I’m exploding inside).

863,"As a type 1 diabetic this is very close to my own personal experience. I was diagnosed when I was a baby; just 1.5 years old. So I've lived with the condition for my entire lifetime, essentially.   


Many people are unaware of what type 1 diabetes actually is, so I'll give a basic rundown just FYI. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system targets and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin (beta cells in the islets of langerhans). Insulin is a critical hormone that allows the body to metabolize glucose for energy. An untreated type 1 diabetic will die within a couple of days, without insulin.   


Contemporary insulins (humalog, novolog, and lantus, etc) have been around for decades with only minor tweaks to the production of those insulins. The price for a 10ml vial of humalog or novolog was around $20, over the counter, without insurance. Those same insulins are now priced at \~ $300 over the counter, without insurance. That's an astronomical price increase without any major change to the formula or production method used.   


I may be off the mark here in just talking about the price of insulin and not talking about billionaires, but you don't need billionaires to understand just how ethically bankrupt our systems are when a product like insulin which is necessary for survival is priced at a point of such staggering profit. It costs something like $6 to produce a 10mL vial of life sustaining insulin, which is then priced at \~ $300. People die because they can't afford to pay that. It's just wrong.",1

The guy had filled the bowl with salad, then made a ring of overlapping cucumber slices to extend the lip of the bowl upwards. He filled that with salad, then added another ring.

Where we get into trouble is things like literature, math, physics (though what a physics might look like to wizarding society is debatable. Obviously things like computer science are right out.

It's possible that some of the gaps are filled via teaching methods that differ from traditional muggle approaches. For example, literature could be effectively integrated into history coursework. 

This seems like a stretch though, we never hear the kids complain about how hard the match is or how much they hate reading a classic novel. I think the real answer is that these subjects are seen as less essential in the wizarding world and possibly even counter to their real world experience.

But even so, they get badly scorched. Knids, which are not heat-proof at all, and don't have any retro-rockets, get sizzled up completely before they're halfway through.

The only way I can think that Wonka could know about the Vermicious Knids is if he's been to other planets. That makes the Oompa-Loompas aliens (but very nice ones).

When Mrs Salt interrupts, Wonka decides to skip the whole ""I've been to another planet"" thing because she's acting so high and mighty. Rather than insult her, he roped her into the conversation as a co-conspirator, and did it in such a way that she'd look more the fool for continuing to protest. After all, who are the rest of the guests going to believe: a geography teacher, or their own eyes?

Anyway, to answer your question: this is far and away outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations. There is a Universal Charter of Human Rights, but this depends largely on the definition of not only ""Universal,"" but also ""Human."" Is an Oompa-Loompa human? They might be insulted if you were to say ""yes."" Especially after the examples they've seen. And as for ""rights"" - well, as Mr Wonka might say, they have all of those, and their lefts, too, thank you very much.",1

Darth Plagueis in his own book talks about how in reality, Jedi who become Sith are basically pussies compared to the others. They don’t have the same violent, all-consuming rage, hatred, and “fuck everything and everyone but me” mentality that natural Sith do. They’re in control of their emotions, which is pretty much the antithesis of the Sith code. Imagine a genuinely devout, deeply religious cardinal vs a televangelist; sure they preach the same shit, but it’s clear which one actually is good at and means it. 

Dooku, even with him already being a few decades older then Palpatine and having principles, was a pretty shitty apprentice in the sense of who would continue their religion and ideology. But if you were looking for a front guy for your schemes, someone charismatic and strong to rally your allies, who could act as your mouthpiece and do the dirty work while you started manipulating the young, super powerful guy you *actually* want as an apprentice, well...",1
891,"In the TV show, there's groups of robbers specialized on robbing during the purge and only in these hours.

One of them was still inside the bank after the sirens went out, so he was charged with a crime. The other didn't and no one went for the money.

So, I think the law says that  what you get on purge night is yours.",1
892,"First:

> **Chancellor Palpatine:** Remember back to your early teachings, Anakin. All those who gain power are afraid to lose it. Even the Jedi.
>
> **Anakin Skywalker:** The Jedi use their power for good.
>
> **Chancellor Palpatine:** Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way. Including their quest for greater power.
>
> **Anakin Skywalker:** The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.
>
> **Chancellor Palpatine:** And the Jedi *don't?*


Second, consider the (apocryphal) Jedi Code:

> There is **no emotion,** there is peace.
>
> There is **no ignorance,** there is knowledge.
> 
> There is **no passion,** there is serenity.
>
> There is **no chaos,** there is harmony.
>
> There is **no death,** there is the Force.

Superficially, these all seem like reassuring, cautionary notes. They're insidious like that. 

* The Jedi encourage their Order to *feel nothing* -- ""no emotion."" Feeling, emoting, being affected by what happens to us and others is the *heart* of empathy. The Jedi caution against it. 
* The Jedi believe they *are not* ignorant; that they *have* the knowledge. This isn't a question of promoting the acquisition of knowledge, it's a statement that they already have it. This is the height of hubris and this way lies naught but bigotry and arrogant presumption.
* No passion? No love? No stirring oneself to action while bearing witness to the suffering of others? No convictions? *This* is laudable?
* No chaos superficially seems good. Keep things stable, predictable... *stagnant.* Don't question. Don't rock the boat. Keep your head down. Do what you're told. Chaos is change. Change can be for the worse or for the better, but *life* is change. Without change -- without chaos -- nothing happens at all.
* Death is everywhere. We face it often. Pretending it doesn't exist, turning a blind eye to death and its consequences, is utterly irresponsible.

By contrast, consider the (apocryphal) Sith Code:

> Peace is a lie, there is only passion.
>
> Through passion, I gain strength.
>
> Through strength, I gain power.
> 
> Through power, I gain victory.
>
> Through victory, my chains are broken.
>
> The Force shall free me.

Peace *is* a lie, when contrasted with passion. Every single Jedi demonstrates a depth of feeling about something at some point. Consider Obi-Wan's anguished cries after he mutilated Anakin. Consider the *fury* in Mace Windu's eyes when he confronted then-Chancellor Palpatine. Consider the weary defeat in Yoda's retreat from his duel with Darth Sidious. Peace and conflict are one another's interregnums. They are both temporary, both impermanent. Seeking perpetual peace *is* a lie.

The next several lines all connect to form a single sentiment: your passions fuel you to overcome the chains that bind you from acting and succeeding in those actions. *Confidence* emerges from this. Changing the world emerges from this. Achieving one's dreams emerges from this. MLK Jr. was *passionate* about Civil Rights. His passion gave him the strength to protest the injustices he saw. His courage and conviction and oratory prowess attracted followers and gained him the power to effect change. And, despite his *assassination*, he helped bring about *tremendous* positive change -- he achieved victory and broke chains. Nothing in the Jedi code correlates to these actions, these successes.

Much is made of ""power"" being evil unto itself. ""Power corrupts"" and ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" -- most everyone has heard these phrases. And power *certainly can* corrupt. One need only look at the current state of political affairs in the U.S. to see the blatant corruption the powerful financial moguls have wrought. But that requires a narrow definition of ""power."" Power -- socially, personally -- is the ability to effect change. To disrupt the status quo. To see a wrong and *decide to make things better.* Without power, nothing happens. Amassing power -- or yoking the collective power of a group -- is the only way to do this. We've seen this throughout history, time and again. 

Granting then that power is not innately evil, but merely the means by which change is effected by an individual, you get into discussions of individual good or evil. Is killing someone good or evil? Makes a difference if the killing happens in cold blood or if it's done in defense of another life being threatened by the person you kill, doesn't it? We call the former murder and the latter self-defense. Context is everything. Have there been evil Sith? Certainly. Have there *also* been evil Jedi? 

The peaceful Republic that preceded the Clone Wars had, under the stewardship of the Jedi, achieved *unprecedented* levels of bureaucracy and corruption to the point where an independent entity could *illegally blockade a world* and the Republic *did nothing* to stop it. They sent some Jedi to negotiate. Period. It was a friggin' blockade! Why didn't the Republic fleet, minimal though it may have been at the time, unleash unmitigated fury against such a blatant act? The Jedi were at the very least complicit if not out-right responsible for the Republic reaching this low. Is that not itself evil, even if it's a mild, passive form of it?

Perhaps we should look at Mace Windu and his entourage going to arrest Chancellor Palpatine without the authority of the Senate backing them. The Jedi *staged a coup* of the *legal government of the Republic*, entirely because Anakin identified Palpatine as a Sith Lord. How do we view countries where one religious group attacks another for control of the country, regardless of whatever history of conflict those religious groups have? 

""But Palpatine orchestrated the Clone Wars! He was behind all that death!"" And the Jedi had what proof of that at the time they went to arrest him? *None*. They had Anakin telling them he thought Palpatine was a Sith Lord. Period. Everything else was speculative. They went to arrest an elected official *without evidence* and without legal authority to do so on the grounds that he was identified to have a different religion and *may* have been connected to an ongoing conflict -- *over which he had presided* **on their side** *to that point!*

It goes on and on. And this all centers around *one* Sith Lord and the question of whether or not he was evil. 

There's nothing innate to the Sith that makes them evil. Indeed, the values they hold are all about self-empowerment to bring about change and throw off oppression in all its forms. The Jedi, by contrast, are about stagnancy and suppression of the self. Which of those sounds more evil to you?

**Obligatory Post-Explosion Edit:** Uh, wow. Thank you all for taking such an interest! It's been great to see the range of responses. 

I'd like to offer a couple of clarifying notes, based on recurring themes that have come up in many replies.

* On the matters of [planetary destruction and/or child murder](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/3k1d0m/star_wars_how_would_you_play_devils_advocate_in/cuwggcv?context=2) and/or [slavery in the Imperial era](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/3k1d0m/star_wars_how_would_you_play_devils_advocate_in/cuwpsmf). TLDR I wholeheartedly object to each of these acts, but also don't find any of them to have any intrinsic basis in Sith teaching.
* [I don't think extreme embrace of *either* Sith or Jedi philosophy does anyone any good](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/3k1d0m/star_wars_how_would_you_play_devils_advocate_in/cuwf3lq), just as I don't think extreme embrace of any terrestrial philosophy does anyone any good. Use distilled codes like these as guidelines, not rulebooks. [The people who ""fall""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/3k1d0m/star_wars_how_would_you_play_devils_advocate_in/cuwf99r) (be they Jedi or Sith) didn't.
* I tried to write this from the perspective of history and events known that lead up to and into the six existing movies. [Stories that come after](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/3k1d0m/star_wars_how_would_you_play_devils_advocate_in/cuwgayb) (i.e. a lot of what Luke did in the Legends continuity after the Death Star II exploded) aren't really a part of how I sought to answer.
* Finally, please keep in mind that this responds to a request to ""play devil's advocate."" In the words of a certain dead Jedi, ""many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view."" I never expected it to be bulletproof, but rather to raise enough questions that one would need to step back and re-evaluate the prevailing and simplistic assumptions about ""Jedi = good, Sith = evil."" 

Again, thank you all. I am delighted to have been able to inspire and share in so much enthusiasm, be it for or against.",1
893,"More Comanche bands were arriving every day, and every warrior among them knew the name of their band, the Quahadi, the Antelope-Eaters. Every Comanche had heard of the Quahadi’s new warband chief. He was young yet not even the oldest warrior would speak before him. His skin was white, but he had proved his loyalty to the Quahadi in raid after raid. Now every one of them looked to the young man for guidance, for wisdom, for strength. He was the greatest buffalo hunter, the greatest horseman, the strongest warrior. And his closest war-brothers knew he was also much more. His name was Pohebits-quasho, “Iron Jacket”, and the tales his war-brothers told of him left their listeners aghast. It was said that bullets bounced off his skin. It was said that he could blow bullets aside with his breath. 

As the warriors gathered Iron Jacket spoke, and the restlessness among them stilled immediately. He spoke with few words, but they were words that brought a great cheer to the listeners. The Comanche would ride this full moon, and Iron Jacket, if they wished, would lead them all. The representatives of the other bands spoke as one, and joined their voices to Iron Jacket’s war-brothers as they cheered him. In two night’s time, the moon would be full. And the Comanche would ride as one tribe.

The battle was over quickly. Iron Jacket rode at the head of the line of a thousand whooping warriors. The Mexican soldiers fired a single volley and fled. He led raids against their towns and villages. For an entire summer he looted and raided, taking hundreds of slaves, and burning thousands of homes. The Mexicans sent their best general against him, but the man returned, pale and ill, with only a handful of his men remaining. He said that Iron Jacket must be a supernatural being, for he had seen the Comanche chief shot dead centre without any harm coming to him. The Mexicans and Texans became terrified of Iron Jacket, and the Comanche became a name to be feared.

Iron Jacket knelt in the dirt as tears poured down his face. His wife and daughter lay under the Wichita mountains, and their belongings lay burning before him, the flames dancing on his tear-soaked face. The smallpox had taken them both, and devastated the Quahada. Barely half of them remained. The rest of the Comanche faced similar woe. Iron Jacket was devastated. He could not eat, he could not speak. His wife’s brother knelt beside him and slashed at his own arms in mourning, as was the custom, showing the depths of his grief. But Iron Jacket could not. His knife slid off his skin harmlessly like it always had. And his heart broke that he could not mourn his beloved wife properly. 

For many years Iron Jacket mourned. And despite their once invulnerability in battle, the Comanche way of life was steadily disrupted. Decimated by the Smallpox, and by the Cholera that followed it, their great warbands no longer rode out every full moon. Their villages became abandoned. Their enemies no longer shook with fear at their name. The buffalo herds were dying as white hunters took them, slaughtering them in greater and greater numbers. The Comanche had no farms, the buffalo were their life. And the white hunters, despite how many the Comanche killed, seemed never ending.

Iron Jacket remarried, and his second wife gave birth to a son. He became known as Lone Wanderer, due to the boy’s habit of disappearing for days on end. Only Iron Jacket knew where the boy went, and only he could follow him, though he never did, appreciating the child’s need for solitude. The burden of leadership weighed heavily on Iron Jacket these days, and he wished he too had a place of solitude to retreat to. But every day brought councils, debates, problems to fix. He could barely afford the time to eat, let alone take time out for himself. A war chief had to be visible at all times, and Iron Jacket was the war chief of war chiefs, the most famous Comanche alive.

The young warriors clamoured for Iron Jacket to gather the warbands again, as he had done before the great dying. He was reluctant, he was superstitious and feared that the death of his first wife was somehow tied to the lives he had taken. He did not know where his abilities came from, he did not know why he could not be touched by bullets or blades, why he seemed to have limitless strength, why the smallpox had not touched him, or why he could travel so far and so fast without exhaustion. His old war-brothers had respected him for his abilities, now he was revered. But he saw the faces of the dead whenever he closed his eyes, not just Comanche, but the white men also. Women and children falling apart in his hands like water. He could not sleep through the night any more. He did not want to go to war again. But his people needed him. And so he must.

The Comanche rode again, and these raids tore the Texan rangers and US army apart. They fell back in disarray, terrified of Iron Jacket, the legend that rode at the head of hundreds of screaming warriors. But though their bullets bounced off Iron Jacket, they did not bounce of his war-brothers. And every brother who lay beneath the mountains was one less brother to ride with them. 

The bands were weak, dying of diseases that Iron Jacket could not see or stop. Having to ride further and further apart, scattering themselves, to find the buffalo. Unable to sleep for the faces of the dead that broke apart and spilled through his hands each night, Iron Jacket ran beneath the moon, travelling vast distances in seconds, searching for the hunters who killed the buffalo. He killed them wherever he found them. But the next month as he searched, he found a village of Comanche instead. They lay slaughtered, fifty women, children, old people, all mutilated in the same way as he had mutilated the hunters. Iron Jacket could not look at them, he staggered away, aghast at the consequences of his actions. He should have known that brutality bred only brutality and war led only to war. 

The Comanche village was dead, and the soldiers walked among the corpses, checking that none survived. Captain Rip Ford stood beside his horse and watched them with an implacable, merciless eye. He cared nothing for these people. Whether they lived or died was nothing to him. But he had orders to take care of the problem and that was what he was going to do. These people understood nothing but killing. Well, they would see Rip Ford knew how to kill Indians. And this Iron Jacket was no different than other powerful chiefs. You never fought them directly if you could help it, you took out their heart first, their homes, their food, their lives. You broke them down until they welcomed death. 

The Tonkawan Indian that sat in front of Rip Ford had a vicious look to him. But to Rip Ford, they all looked like that. He eyed the man suspiciously. He said his name was Pockmark, and he was well-named, the pox had scarred him deeply. But he led a force of hundreds of Tonkawa warriors, and they hated the Comanche who had long raided their fellow Indians just as much as anyone else. More than this, Pockmark said he had a way to kill Iron Jacket. Rip Ford was interested.

Iron Jacket sat, silently, in his hut. His war-brothers sat outside, fearful, worried. They had brought their great chief the news of the approaching army, that it had massacred the village a day’s journey down the river. But Iron Jacket hadn’t even replied. He had just gone into his hut and sat. He had barely moved since his son had left the last time and not returned. Lone Wanderer was gone, perhaps for ever. They had argued before he went, Lone Wanderer had said that this was not why they had their abilities, this brutal, bloody war. This endless killing. He had refused to be a part of it any more. Iron Jacket had not spoken a word since he left. He had no one left to comfort him. His war-brothers were young, his old companions long dead in raids and illness. His second wife was also dead now from a bout of measles which had torn through their band and left them a shadow of its former self.

The White men and their Tonkawan allies lined up outside Iron Jacket’s village. For the last time Iron Jacket mounted his horse, still leaping into the saddle in a single bound as he had done as a youth. But his face was weary, his eyes hooded, and his mouth heavily drawn. His last war-brothers lined up beside him. Many had come from the Comanche bands nearby. The name of Iron Jacket could still raise an army. He rode out alone to the lines of soldiers. He saw their captain, a hard-faced man with cold eyes. He fixed him with a stare that threatened to burn the man alive where he sat. But he could not do it this time, he could not face more death. Iron Jacket rode up and down the lines of soldiers, as they fired at him, their bullets bouncing off his skin as they had always done. He could at least do this, he could at least give his brothers courage. 

Pockmark grinned without humour as he pulled the oilcloth off his great buffalo gun. He raised it up, already loaded. He had bought the sliver of green rock from an old medicine man for a great price, more than he could afford. But if it worked it would be worth it. His own family were dead at the hands of this monster. Pockmark would avenge them, he would not falter. With a cry of rage he fired. The great Iron Jacket turned in his saddle at the cry, for an instant he looked straight at Pockmark, seeing the gun in his hands. But he did not move, or dodge the shot. He sat there, and shook in his seat as the green stone tore his iron skin open. As he slumped to the side and fell from his saddle his brothers cried out in horror. Rip Ford did not even smile as he raised his sabre at the lines of Indians before him. “Kill them all”, he said.

903,"There are 26 *high level* agents, each with a single letter code name.  These are the agents with a large amount of autonomy and respect, the best of the best.  They are the ones that get the ""world is about to end"" missions.  A single letter agent can grab any other agent and order him to fetch a glass of chocolate milk and it would happen no question.  Then there are up to 676 secondary agents with double letter codes.  They're the ones who deal with an alien that needs to be served a fine for an expired human suit, or other non-emergency grunt work.  Double letter agents will occasionally get teamed up with single letter agents.  This is a sign that they may be being groomed for higher levels, and when a single letter agent retires or is killed this is the pool they pull the replacement from.  Contrary, a double letter may often get assigned slime vacuum duty or sitting at a desk at intake customs.  This is a sign they're going nowhere.

There was an agent that was recruited directly to single letter status, without having to put in the time as double letter, but that was a unique case and the agent that recruited him was the most respected agent ever so had a lot of leeway.

The MiB division that operates out of America was the first and set many of the precedents, so generally other countries follow their lead and stick to 26 letters from the English alphabet, though that's not always the case.  For example, MiB Russia has 32 single letter agents with Cyrillic letter names.  MiB China has 25 single letter agents with pinyin characters, though there are grumblings at the ""Westernization"" of their agency.

Anakin was the son of a single mother who never knew a father (or had a father figure) and was chattel - he was a slave without rights and whose future was bereft of dignity or hope. One day a magical supermonk tells him he's special, and he's thrown into this galactic conflict he knows basically nothing about - he's still just as a kid.
The supermonk's sidekick decides that after gaining his freedom, Anakin should join a special boarding school to learn magic. So far in the story, he's been given very little choice in any life decisions

He grows up indoctrinated into this religion of supermonks, and often finds himself in life-threatening situations, all while being told (in hushed tones) that he's the Chosen One. The years go by, he grows up, and the psychological trauma of his routine near-death experiences combined with the transition from slave to Chosen One are beginning to take their toll - he wants to do what *he* wants, for a change. 

Suddenly, he falls in love - head over heels - with an older woman with a burgeoning political career, and he realizes it's forbidden by his teachers, friends, and colleagues. This is a critical moment -- as a slave he could not make decisions for himself,  then as a Padawan he could not make decisions for himself, and now as a Jedi Knight he's told he cannot make *certain* decisions for himself. 

Then, his mother dies in a cruel and horrible manner. The murder of the Tusken Raiders is more than just an emotional response of a grieving soldier, it's also the culmination of years of frustration, anger, and confusion, combined with poor mental health and a lack of proper discipline. He's not *evil*, but he's certainly not good, either. He's flawed, like everyone else. Only in his line of work, he's not allowed to be flawed. That kind of pressure takes its toll, and the death of his mother broke him, mentally and emotionally.

Anakin tells himself it's not fair, and comes to realize *life* in the galaxy isn't fair. Despite his abilities, his fame, his prowess, and his skill, he is denied fundamental access to life's joys - a wife, a mother, a family. Everyone in his life has basically told him that, no, he can't do as he pleases. He is not free. He cannot do or have certain things. And, like a petulant child, he instantly rebels by marrying the woman he loves in secret. He forms an intimate, emotional bond to help him cope.

Then, a galactic war breaks out, putting his life in constant danger. His new wife is being put in danger as well. He desperately wants to control the situation. Wants to protect her, and himself, in the vain hope that one day, when it's all over, they can be free together. She falls pregnant, and he is elated. But in his mind, the risk has now grown, too. He has so much to lose, having gained so much since his early life as a child slave on a backwater planet.

There are such exclusions in other types of insurance policies, but they are limited.  There can be an Acts of God exclusion in a liability policy under your auto policy.   


Long Answer :   


We need to define what an ""Act of God"" is.  It's different than acts of A God (or god, or demigod, or whatever).  


What Is an Act Of God?  


An act of God describes an event outside of human control or activity. It's usually a natural disaster, such as a flood or an earthquake. Insurance policies usually specify which particular acts of God they cover.   
In business, the phrase “act of God” is not associated with any particular religion or belief system. Contractual language referring to acts of God are known as force majeure clauses, which are often used by insurance companies. These clauses typically limit or remove liability for injuries, damages, and losses caused by acts of God.  
So, we've got our definition.  


So, let's go on to your auto policy.  There are several parts:    


liability coverage, for when you run into something and it's your fault, and the insurance company pays for the damage that you caused (to someone else's property),   


collision coverage, which pays for damage to your vehicle while it is being driven, and   


comprehensive coverage, which covers almost everything else.  


So damage to your vehicle from ""Acts of God"" IS COVERED under comprehensive coverage.   That are things like:   
Natural calamities such as a tornado, hurricane, flood, hail etc.  


Comprehensive coverage also covers things like:  

Theft or attempted theft of the car itself or any spare parts including accessories  

Falling objects, which include missiles or debris from construction sites  

Fire  

A civil unrest such as a riot or protest rally that may cause damage to your car or destroy it  

Vandalism that may be slashing the tires, keying, scratches on the body paint

Edit 1:

I did not consider one exclusion that might prevent coverage for applying.  Again, it's not because of an ""Act of God"" but this one:

( this comes from a 1987 version of a Travelers Insurance Personal Auto Policy. Fascinating read, by the way).

EXCLUSIONS 
We  will not  pay  for:

3. Loss due  to or  as a  consequence  of:

a. radioactive  contamination; 

b. discharge  of  any nuclear  weapon (even if  accidental); 

c. war (declared  or  undeclared);

d. civil war;

e. insurrection; or

f. rebellion or  revolution.

923,"""Big ugly squid.""  I wish I was still that innocent, still unaware of what...*they* really are.  Once you know, once you really understand - or if you are among those damned to witness it yourself - once you know, you will never forget.  It keeps me up at night, and if not for my physician's pity I would never sleep at all.

Squids. It's charming, frankly - the Old Gods, with bloated and frowning faces writhing with tentacles like the beard of Neptune.  Like a God of Egypt, with a man's body and an animal's head.  A curiosity, and little more.

The truth...well, I cannot tell you the truth, not properly, as a man of science should.  These things are beyond our science.  Still, I understand things about them that explain some of the reports, and perhaps you can carry on my research now that I can no longer pursue it.

It comes down to dimensions.  We possess three - height, width, and depth.  Grip a billiard ball, feel your fingers wrap around it, and you will understand.  Now imagine a creature that existed in only two of those three dimensions, in a universe that described a simple plane through our own. To that creature, the billiard ball would appear to be a simple circle, growing and shrinking as it passes through the plane of the creature's universe. Imagine how our hand would look - strange fleshy circles filled with pulsing fluids, shards of bone, glistening meat. The creature could never understand what it was really seeing, as it could no more conceive of a hand than it could imagine a creature like us, moving freely in three dimensions and gripping billiard balls on a whim.

The Abominations, as you aptly described them, are to us as we are to that benighted creature. They exist in dimensions beyond our own, whose nature we can hardly guess.  When they appear to us, we see only fragments of their bodies - long stretches of writhing flesh, glistening with juices that should not exist outside of a body, which whip through the air and vanish back where they came from in a way that our minds simply refuse to accept.  Witnesses have tried to describe these as great tentacles, words failing them in the presence of such incomprehensibility.  Those who heard the stories seized on this, and explained them as resembling cephalopods.  This is a comforting lie, as there is nothing in the most stygian depths of the darkest sea that is not our beloved brother compared to the horrors of the Abominations.

This is a creature who is incomprehensibly alien, and our only glimpse is a sickening flash of writhing, elongated flesh that slips into our world and back out.  Worse than the appearance of the creature, though, is its *disappearance* - your mind knows, on some level, that this creature - this hateful, hungry god of a creature - is not moving it's body between ""here"" and ""away"", but between being a glimpse of a writhing horror, and a horror that watches unseen.

Imagine our two-dimensional creature again, and imagine yourself to be a cruel child. If you chose to torment the creature, it would be powerless to resist.  It cannot perceive you unless you chose to intersect its plane - you can watch its every move, and it cannot hope to escape your gaze. It would be the simplest thing in the world to push a pin through it, like a butterfly on a card. Take a glass of water and push it into the creature's plane and it will find itself trapped, drowning, in an inescapable sea. The creature is entirely at your mercy, and always will be.

Same as you.  Same as me.

925,"He was very good at his job, and he didn't get killed.

Take note of the sheer number of heroes in Edna's ""cape-kill"" montage; they were all very clearly trying to fill the ""Superman Niche"" in terms of how they presented themselves. Meta Man in particular went so far as to try and form the setting's version of the Justice League with himself at the head. Despite their incredible power and great branding, every single one of them got overconfident and died stupid, stupid deaths.

Mr. Incredible is tough and strong enough to be versatile, but the fact he's not invulnerable means he isn't fatally arrogant. From the scene where he stops the robbers while also saving the cat we know that he's good at  thinking on his feet, multi-tasking and thinking strategically; he went up against the Omnidroid on it's thirtieth or fortieth iteration, and he was still able to identify it's weaknesses and take it out in about ten minutes flat.  His skill at heroics, his raw dedication to helping people, his decent charisma, and the simple fact he didn't die meant he was destined to be a very popular hero.

In a world where almost every hero was systematically killed, He's one of the few OGs still remaining. That says something.",1
926,"He is a good wizard, but not the greatest one and not for the reasons you listed. Let's break it down.

>He was the first person to ever escape Azkaban. 

He didn't get out on his own nor by using magic himself. His mother was dying and asked his father to help their son. They were granted one last visit due to her condition and that's when she switched places with her son. If we are going to talk about scaping prison, then Sirius would have the upper hand or even Grindelwald.

> He broke free of the Imperious curse after constantly being under it for twelve years. 

Took him 12 years to do so. Harry not only resisted but broke free out of Imperius cursed placed on him by Barty Crouch Jr when he was in class in a couple of minutes. 

>He snuck up and got the drop on Mad-Eye Moody who has an eye that can see through everything including Harry’s deathly hallow cloak. 

Crouch Jr. was aided by Pettigrew in ambushing Moody. Ambushing someone in a 2x1 fight is not fair, especially if we need to take into consideration that Moody was not in his best days. He was already old and handicapped. 

>fooled all the staff at Hogwarts for a year (including Snape whom he constantly stole pollyjuice ingredients from), fooled Dumbledore and then hacked Dumbledore’s spell on the goblet to enter Harry, 

This requires great magical abilities, indeed.  


> figured out how to win every event at the triwizard tournament and gaslight Harry through it, 

He didn't really figure out. As a professor, he knew what each event would be beforehand. And fooling a kid as he did, doesn't require magical abilities, just requires to be a manipulative person which he was.

> turned the cup into a Portkey within Hogwarts’ grounds,

The feat here was adding a second location to teleport to the cemetery first. I don't think there are any restrictions on making a portkey within Hogwarts grounds.

> and taught an impressive Defence Against the Dark Arts course for an entire school year whilst pretending to be someone else. 

He was well versed in the dark arts, so that makes him a good teacher on the matter and it's shown when he teaches about the unforgivable curses, but I don't think that makes him an impressive teacher on the matter.",1

931,"You're not going to get a single correct answer because ""Vampires"" isn't a single, cohesive genre of fiction. Given how popular vampires are, you are going to find examples of this limitation that cross the spectrum:

No Invitation Required - Twilight

Invitation can be implicit (Fright Night, Buffy) or Explicit (True Blood)

Applies to any building, but also anyone can invite in (What We Do In The Shadows) or only privately owned residences (Fright Night)

Invitation is Permanent (Buffy) or can be revoked (True Blood)

The invitation might be restricted to owners, occupants, or anyone that happens to be there.

In the Dungeon's and Dragon's module ""Curse of Strahd"" one of the unwritten loopholes is that the Vampire Strahd is the feudal lord over all the land and is technically the ""owner"" of every residence there-in (the people are merely his tenants) and he doesn't need a formal invitation.

955,"> We only have so many senses ... normal electromagnetic radiation is all we can perceive with our eyes.

Are you sure?

When you were a child, you were probably taught that you have five senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. This is true, but it's incomplete.

You have plenty of other senses. A sense of balance. A sense of time passing. A sense of changing temperatures. A sense of where your body is in space. A sense of acceleration. A sense of pain. A sense of loss. A sense of joy. A sense of agency. A sense of belonging.

You perceive the world around you in a dozen different, subtle ways, many of which you can't even name, and most of which you are completely unaware of, unless something goes wrong.

The right (or wrong) stimulus can completely change our psychology. When someone sees the Grand Canyon for the first time, they often report a feeling of overwhelming awe at the sheer size and spectacle. When astronauts return from space, return from seeing this great world of ours reduced to a tiny blue marble out the window, the report a sense of overwhelming concern for, and oneness with, humanity. When someone takes psilocybin or DMT, they report an expansion of their mind that fundamentally alters who they are as a person.

But what about people who have seen the horrors of war? People who have suffered at the hands of an abusive lover? Or people who have suffered something as simple as a car crash, and now break out in a cold sweat every time they drive? The wrong stimulus, applied to our normal, human senses, can irreparable harm us.

When someone sees a Great Old One, the sheer monstrous nature of it, the impossibility, the implacability, the inhuman and inhumane *otherness* of the thing that they have laid eyes on, is enough to shatter, completely and forever, their sense of who and what and why they are. It's like looking at the splendor of the Grand Canyon and realizing that it will absolutely destroy you, not because it hates you, not because it needs to, but because that is simply *what it is*.

Just as you were unaware of the fact that you *aren't* falling until I just mentioned it, you are not aware of the fact that you believe that you are important, that you matter, that you have any hope at all of making a difference in this vast and careless universe until something forces you to confront that fact. And that is what the Great Old Ones do. When you look upon them, you are looking at a power so vast and ancient and amoral that any sense of normalcy you once had will be forever torn away.

And that's just what we can explain with out current understanding of the human mind. Who's to say that we don't have some other sense, a sense of the cosmic, a sense of the psychic, that is triggered by the presence of a Great Old One? Who's to say that some sense, long dormant in the safety of our comfortable little world, isn't woken up as soon as one of those eldritch abominations appears before us?",1

968,"I think it's a combination of three things: 

First, the Asgardians had *very* little time between rediscovering the Aether and being invaded by Dark Elves. Nobody had seen it for eons. The knowledge Odin inherited was a flat-out lie regarding whether the Aether still existed and certainly did not include details like how to remove it. 

Second, there was little incentive for Odin to extract the Aether while it was contained. Removing the aether may have been a very bad idea without a sure way to destroy it (a mistake Thor makes later on). Odin would have had no problem sacrificing Jane if necessary. He regularly sacrifices Asgardians to achieve goals and he values humans far less.

Third, the Aether has its own intent and seemed both hostile to Asgardians/Humans and 'friendly' to the Dark Elves. Two Asgardians got thrown across a room just for touching Jane while it left willingly for Malekith. It's possible that this was taken advantage of in some way to extract it or, at least, that Malekith possessed the knowledge of how to control it (indicating that it was a matter of technique rather than pure technological ability).",1
969,"This is sort-of explained in a novel that serves as a prequel to the story of *Absolution* as well as some of the earlier games - Agent 47 is a boogeyman of sorts, only rumored to exist by federal agencies who aren't aware of him (the CIA knows since they've hired him before). But for everyone else, there's no reason to *believe* he's killing people.

And you want to know why? Because by official canon, all of 47's kills are declared to be *accidents*. There's always a way to kill his targets in-game using a non-obvious means and when taken, nobody bats an eye. In fact, killing people this way as of the game *Blood Money* means that they're not even registered as kills in the game's scoring system.

And going back to Absolution's prequel book, 47's reputation of doing so has actually become legendary in the ICA to the point where some of their agents botched a high-profile contract by attempting to perform their own accident kills and screwing things up.

And going back to Blood Money, it's actually a sort-of example because it's used to measure your overall performance in the game. As you complete each mission, you'll see a newspaper article discussing the events that happened during the level. This actually serves as your overall rating for the game up to that point, and the more obvious your murders are, the more the headlines talk about 47 and will slowly reveal more and more details about him, including better police sketches until they see your face. Later levels will also be harder since the NPCs will recognise you from the papers.

To lower your reputation, you need to replay the older levels and get a better mission rating, with the in-canon reason being that Agent 47 never left any evidence and was always ranked ""Silent Assassin"".

Also, he's surprisingly good at blending into disguises and fooling people, helped by his face being mixed-race and easily passing for no-one in particular, not helped by his wide range of skills.",1

979,"I think we can reasonably assume that no one really knows how peter got his powers.  MCU spidey's origins haven't been elaborated upon. While past movies have had the spider be genetically engineered, this spider could have just been a total radioactive fluke. Peter might not even know how the spider gave him powers, we just don't have the information.

Further Spider-man is an enigma to the public. As far as most of the world knows he is just some dude that hangs around queens stopping crime and occasionally helps the avengers/Tony Stark. With this in mind, most people even higher officials might just assume that spider-man doesn't have powers and is instead using tech. As of right now alot of heroes in the MCU either don't have powers, or they get their powers from technology (iron man, war machine, falcon, ant-man, wasp, black widow, hawkeye).

But I think the out of universe explanation is simply that the MCU has actively avoided peter's origins (either because of their contract with sony or for creative reasons.)

2) As for why not just let them keep digging, Indy knew that it would only be a matter of time before they realized they were in the wrong spot, Belloq was still a good archeologist.

When he heard the Avengers fended off the Chitauri, he was like “oh those guys? Those guys are the worst, don’t tell me, you just blew up their mothership and they all fell over? Nobody takes them seriously”

Not sure if Rocket was being serious or if he was  just taking the piss out of the Avengers. 

Either way, I think Earth still wins against the Chitauri. From what we’ve seen, those guys aren’t nuke proof. Even a tiny tactical nuke launched from a single fighter was enough to annihilate their flagship. Earth has like, tens of thousands of strategic nukes that are thousands of times more powerful. 

And even without nukes, the Chitauri don’t seem bullet or missile proof. So yeah, New York is fucked, and maybe some parts of the Eastern Seaboard, but no more than that. Loki was a bit of an idiot.

However, because the casualties are in the millions instead of the hundreds, and the conflict rages on for weeks instead of a couple hours, the world doesn’t see the Battle of New York as a triumphant victory, but as a horrifying wake up call.

The world pours stupid amounts of money into “defense” spending and Hydra gets way stronger as a result. Thor isn’t the brightest bulb in the lighthouse, so he’s only too happy to help his human buddies.

Project Insight works without a hitch - Fury dies, Hill dies, all the targets including Dr. Strange, the Ancient One, Peter Parker etc. die. 

The American government, understandably, is totally freaked out by these three helicarriers vaporizing hundreds of thousands of its citizens. But presumably, the Hydra coup goes off without a hitch, and the US and its nuclear Arsenal is swiftly brought under Hydra’s control.

If the rest of the world acts quickly enough and nukes the US to stop Hydra, the world turns into a radioactive death ball and Thor is sad. Maybe he’ll try and get a few humans into Asgard as refugees.

But if Hydra’s plans go smoothly, they’ll be able to enact coups on all other nuclear capable governments and bring them under their control before the missiles start flying. 

They build more helicarriers, and soon the entire world has a gigantic instant death ray gun pointed at their head at all times, ready to go off on a hair trigger. 

Every few seconds or so, some person somewhere on the world starts thinking about maybe doing something about Hydra, like distributing a few photocopied pro democracy pamphlets, or buying a can of spray paint and graffitiing “down with Hydra” on some back alley somewhere.

A couple minutes after they start having these subversive thoughts, a blast of energy from their city’s helicarrier vaporizes them instantly, while also severely burning a few innocent bystanders and starting a fire in the apartment building. 

Hydra could have had them quietly arrested, tried, then executed. But a surprise giant death ray from above is something the entire city can see and hear, and it’s more effective at keeping up morale. 

The efforts of Hydra turn to the subjugation of Wakanda. Wakanda isn’t scared of nukes or Project Insight energy weapons because they have powerful force fields.

But Hydra has billions, and all the resources of planet Earth at their command, and Wakanda just has a couple million. Best case scenario is a kind of stalemate, where Wakanda is under constant siege from the rest of the Hydra controlled world, while Black Panther and the War Dogs conduct guerrilla operations to spark anti-Hydra uprisings. Lots of people get vaporized, and East Africa is turned into a giant radioactive war zone ruined by high tech superweapons.

It’s possible that Hydra has scientists smart enough to use the Mind Stone like Tony did, and create something similar to Ultron. If this Hydra made Ultron manages to hack into the Project Insight helicarriers, it could take over the world pretty quickly. 

Wakanda is still under siege, but this time it’s by robots and enslaved cyborg humans instead of Hydra. 

There’s a good chance that Earth’s wizards are too busy trying to escape Hydra or Ultron, and are unable to stop Dormammu. Strange died years ago when Project Insight was activated.

Dormammu swallows Earth, but gets a little indigestion from the Infinity stones kept there. 

When Thanos comes looking for the stones, he finds Earth missing. He asks his own wizards for advice, and they tell him about Dormammu.

Not sure how Thanos could fight Dormammu without a Time Stone. It might not even be possible, even with lots of help from his alien magicians. 

So the snap never happens, because Dormammu has eaten the Infinity Stones and Thanos is unable to get to them. 

Thanos continues his “killing half the universe” crusade the slow, old fashioned way, until somebody stops him or he dies of old age.

Life goes on. Hardly anyone notices that Earth vanished, except Thor and Peter Quill. They mourn for a bit, then move on.

EDIT:

Ok turns out I totally forgot about Captain Marvel. If Fury manages to send out his distress signal to her before getting killed, she would make her way back to Earth and whup Hydra’s ass six ways to Sunday. Project Insight helicarrier beams and thermonuclear weapons are scary, but Danvers is pretty much indestructible. 

So yeah things don’t turn out too bad. Carol, possibly with the help of the Skrulls, Wakanda and the wizards, defeat Hydra. The real problem comes from if Hydra decides to kill as many people as they can out of spite before they go down. 

Maybe they try to force Danvers to back off by telling her “if you don’t leave the solar system we’ll nuke all the major cities and have the helicarriers zap everyone who’s left”

But I think Danvers is the sort to call their bluff and just come zooming in anyway. I assume Hydra would have members who are still somewhat reasonable and interested in their own survival, so they’ll overthrow their more fanatical/crazed companions, and halt the mass global suicide in hopes of maybe getting a sympathetic jury at their trial.

So yeah, with Danvers in the picture, Hydra/Ultron is defeated, though possibly only after billions of casualties. 

Whether or not Earth wins against Dormammu depends on how many wizards are left alive (maybe hiding out under a Wakandan force field city?), and whether or not there are wizards among them ballsy and talented enough to use the time stone to defeat Dormammu.

If they do defeat Dormammu, that still leaves Thanos as a major threat. It’s possible that Danvers might try and convince the Skrulls to take refuge on Earth instead. I doubt the humans would mind too much, after all the crazy shit they’ve gone through, and they’ll gladly do anything Danvers suggests. That way, she can keep a 24/7 watch on both a devastated Earth and the Skrulls.

Thanos turns up looking for the stones, but because Danvers is already on Earth, his entire fleet is blasted out of the sky not long after he warps into orbit. Earth and Danvers are a little confused, but the Skrulls and maybe a few Asgardians explain who he was, and they go “oh huh nice. Good thing Captain Marvel was here and not, I dunno, a couple light years away from these critically important Infinity Stones.”

What’s left of the Nova Corps and Asgardians are happy that Thanos was defeated in like, 5 minutes. 

Thor in particular is happy somebody avenged his people, but is a little upset he didn’t find out about Captain Marvel sooner. That would have saved a whole lot of Asgardians lives (assuming the events of Thor Ragnarok play out) 

Thanos becomes a historical footnote, and nobody misses him except Nebula and Gamora, and even they are glad that he’s dead.

Life goes on, but now Earth is under Danver’s constant watch. She knows what happened the last time she flew off to some part of the galaxy. Never again.

Danvers doesn’t seem like the sort to go mad with power and conquer Earth as an immortal indestructible dictator. It’s likely she’d stay aloof from politics, just intervening during humanitarian crises, showing up and looking pissed every time say, policemen beat up peaceful protestors, or governments have ethnic minorities dragged into concentration camps, or militaries and terrorists bomb innocent civilians. 

She won’t be able to solve all of Earth’s problems, but a lot of the more obviously evil acts would be reduced significantly if there’s an angry glowing demigod hovering above the scene, glaring and giving everyone a “don’t fuck with me” look.

Clean water would be easy to come by too, for drought struck areas. She could just boil thousands of liters of seawater with her cosmic powers, then carry it in big containers to where it’s needed. 

Earth’s space program would also get a big head start with all the scavenged alien tech and Wakandan/Skrull technological assistance. And Danvers could help greatly reduce launch costs by just flying payloads into space.

Earth becomes a proper spacefaring civilization in a couple decades. Maybe they’d do it the slow way and colonize the Lagrange points, the moon, asteroid belts, Mars, Europa etc. Or maybe they’d join the galactic community properly. 

The Kree would hate them because Earth is harboring Skrulls and Captain Marvel. But there’s not much they can do to her, so they’re limited to cloak and dagger skulduggery and political maneuvering. 

Peter Quill could probably put in a good word for Earth with the Nova Corps. They’d be even more welcoming once they realize that humans aren’t all doofuses like Peter. 

Also they might not want to mess with a planet harboring Asgardians, Skrull, multiple Infinity Stones, an Infinity Stone powered superwoman, and is the home planet of a half human half god war hero. 

So yeah, with Captain Marvel in the picture, Dormammu doesn’t have Earth as lunch, and things turn out ok in the end. Not as interesting, but happier",1

I think the more interesting answer is that he was born with that little spark of greed and selfishness that not event he Jedi could purge. 

________________________________

Because he's so powerful, Palpatine was taken as Yoda's personal Padewan. Yoda not only respects the potential power of Palpatine, but sees him acting selflessly (albeit with great passion) on a number of occasions, and believes that Palpatine could be a powerful force for good in the universe. He always has a nagging concern about Palpatine's passionate nature. Yoda spends countless hours working with Palpatine to embrace the stoic nature of the Jedi order, to understand that passion runs the risk of turning the power of the Force into a drug. What Yoda doesn't know is that it's been too late from the start. Palpatine had been controlling his parents through the influence of the Force for years before begin recruited, and had already affected planetary affairs on Naboo. As a Jedi, he had similarly been using his incredible influential faculties to build a secret following among the other most powerful Padewan. He's simply biding his time, with he and his followers soaking up all the Jedi training. 

Palpatine, eventually, locates and makes contact with Darth Plagueis. Plagueis is intrigued both by Palpatine's power and by his place within the Jedi order. Plagueis, busy with developing Force powers for the ends of immortality and the creation of life, charges Palpatine with becoming head of the Jedi Order and placing his other Dark Jedi on the council, intending to eventually return to a Sith order. 

While Plagueis is busy attempting to master Force impregnation, Palpatine (now secretly Darth Sidious) becomes a master, one of the youngest in history, and sits on the council. He's able to eventually manipulate the Jedi into thinking the Sith have returned and have taken control of the Senate, partially by staging the mysterious deaths of a number of Jedi council members and making it look like the work of an anti-Jedi faction. The Jedi move to investigate, but end up being spread quite thin. More Jedi begin mysteriously dying, and as it happens, more and more of Sidious' allies join the council. 

Eventually, Yoda is surrounded by enemies, perception clouded. Sidious, young and in his absolute prime, draws his lightsaber in the council chambers and kills the remaining pure Jedi, save for Yoda. Yoda, having gleaned enough of the plan to prepare, utilizes a Force ability never seen before: a Jedi thought bomb. The remaining powerful Jedi had mastered an ancient Sith technique in order to create a destructive force to wipe out the Force-sensitive in one fell swoop. The bomb detonates and instantly wipes out everyone in the room, save for Sidious, who is barely able to shield himself utilizing all of his Force power. So much power is used to defend himself, that Jedi across the galaxy feel the effect, including Plagueis. 

Sidious is scarred by the experience, his face looking like a skull, with sunken in eyes, but is able to heal himself. 

Obi Wan, having been given the position of new leader of the Jedi Council, takes the remaining Jedi and flees to the Outer Rim to regroup. Every Jedi in the galaxy is called to Dantooine. Obi Wan, who is working with the Force spirit of both Qui Gon Jin and Yoda, is able to help focus the remaining Jedi into a new kind of organization, a more pure form of the Jedi, whereby each individual Jedi is part of a collective mind using the Force. They're all individuals, but can access a single consciousness for the communication of ideas and the combining of Force sensitivity. Through this practice, a hundred Jedi, each individually unremarkable, combine to have the shared mind of an extremely powerful Force-sensitive sentient. It's through this that they discover the conception of Anakin Skywalker. 

While Sidious rebuilds the Jedi order into a secret Sith order, the remaining Jedi all descend on Tatooine. Plagueis is engaged by hundreds of Jedi, all acting in perfect concert with each other, and despite his great power is easily defeated. Sidious is aware of his master's death, and begins to assert more power over the Senate. 

Simi Skywalker is brought back to Dantooine, where she is cared for and is educated in the ways of the Force (she herself was highly Force-sensitive). Obi Wan explains what's happened to her, how she will give birth to the one who is prophesied to bring balance to the Force. She accepts her son's destiny and agrees to help, with the caveat that Anakin be given the opportunity to choose when he comes of age. 

The Jedi move about the Outer Rim, acting as selfless peacekeepers and recruiting the young Force-sensitive, rebuilding the Order to be stronger and more pure than before, and free of influence or danger. 

Sideious, meanwhile, has a full-fledged Sith order and manages to get  the ""Jedi"" a seat in the Senate with veto power, eventually placing a puppet chancellor at the head, a bold, beloved nobleman named Count Dukuu. Sideius' personal assassin, Darth Maul, slays the Senators who stand in the way, including a queen from Naboo. It's only a decade before the Sith rule the former Republic, now an Empire. 

When planets begin to withdraw from the Republic, Sidious finds them mysteriously capable of fending off Sith assassins. Fourteen different Sith die while on missions to assassinate leadership of seceding worlds. Eventually, he sends Darth Maul to investigate, and Maul catches a group of Jedi on a CIS planet. He's initially outmatched, which surprises him given that he's an especially capable Sith warrior. He gleans, during the fight, that there's a mental connection between the Jedi, and he uses that against them, eventually wiping them out. 

During the fight, when Maul gleaned the Force connection between the Jedi, he glimpsed a great deal more about what was going on. Pademe Amadala was alive, her double having been killed, and was acting as as liaison from the New Jedi Order to the Confederacy of Independent Systems. They weren't declaring independence individually, but as part of a larger strategy of the Jedi. And the Confederacy was huge, thirty times the amount of worlds that was known to the Sith. The new Jedi, including Anakin, were all nearly adults, and would soon retake the Jedi Temple and purge the entire Empire of the Sith once and for all. 

Maul, realizing the gravity of the information he possessed, fled to get back to Sidious as soon as possible with this information. Just as he's about to get to his ship, though, a young man in a cloak walks out of Maul's own ship and draws two lightsabers. Maul's taken aback at the immense Force-sensitivity of the boy. 

""Who are you?""

""I am Anakin, a Jedi Knight.""

1034,"No. The Furious Five were already beginning to warm up to Po before the escape, which we see from the scene where they try his noodles.

His wise counsel might have eventually prevailed over Shifu's stodgy expectations. Po clearly has a knack for kung-fu, and work ethic to spare. In time, he probably would have become a powerful master like the rest of the Five.

A more interesting question is if Po would have ended up like Tai Lung. Shifu's training produced two extraordinarily talented and powerful masters who were totally reliant on external validation to function. Po was already kind of a people-pleaser before he was selected to be Dragon Warrior, and we see how committed he is to sticking with his training no matter how brutal it is. Tai Lung was such an overwhelming threat, his coming forced everyone in the Jade Palace to come to terms with their own limitations, which is what pushed Po to finally accept himself for who he was. Without that push, he might have made for a very interesting villain.",1
1035,"In some circumstances, they're on the tail end of their time of prominence, and have been fading away for a long time. On Middle-Earth, for instance, the days of whole empires populated with Elves are thousands of years in the past, and the remaining ones are the ones who haven't *quite* gotten sick of the world and struggle and so on and so forth, *yet*. They're all just a few more headaches away from getting on a ship and going to literal Heaven, which is a thing they get to do. Heck, a bunch of them have been there already, came back, and know precisely how nice it is.

Similarly, in the WH40k universe, they spent so much time being the absolute king-shits of the galaxy that they got tired of being diligent, got very, very, very, very, very decadent, and essentially partied themselves to destruction.

In others, in many many others, it's not that they *don't* breed, it's that they breed *slowly*, compared to everything else. It doesn't matter how desperate a human might be to increase numbers, you're still not going to get more than a kid or two out every few years. For elves, in most cases, no matter how desperate the situation, it's still going to take years to produce each kid, and even then, you still might not get families much larger than a comparable human family. Depending on the setting, the fertile time for elves might also be limited. Consider that Elrond was around for at least 6.000 years, and only had, what, 3 kids?

Similarly, their wacky relationship with age can cause issues. An individual adult elf is powerful and skilled and can overcome great odds, and might be at the top of his game for centuries, or even millennia, but it takes that elf a couple of hundred years to get to that point. It takes humans, in comparison, a couple of decades to reach full strength, and there are always more of the sweaty monkeys coming up right behind them.

Elves represent quality, sure, but without *quantity*. Humans (or whatever) will out-breed them most of them time.

&#x200B;

(that being said, there are places where Elves are dominant, even over the long term. Both Arianus and Pryan in *The Death Gate Cycle* have elves being powerful nations that completely dominate their human neighbors.)",1
1036,"In human culture, sexual reproduction is intricately entangled with social hierarchies.

In many such pairings, it is established that one partner (often the masculine/father figure, but interestingly not always) has explicit dominance over the other (the feminine/mother figure). There are some indications that this arrangement was a survival trait for early humanity, although its endurance is a result of biochemical adaptation and cultural transmission rather than as a rational choice humanity has collectively made.

As such, humans, when in competition across such as arenas as sports, careers, sexual selection, and indeed war, tend to express their assertion of dominance/superiority in sexual terms. Equating their victory with a sexual assault is not uncommon, though in polite society it is considered uncouth. Likewise, sexual markers like large genitalia, virility, and secondary characteristics such as beard growth and height are perceived as correlating with success or winning- the nature of the correlation is not clear, as no studies have definitively proven whether humans think that success will impart these characteristics or whether these characteristics assure success.

The War Dance of the Tea Bag is one such example of this entanglement of sex reproduction and dominance in competition. The “dipping” motion simulates inserting the warrior’s genitals into his fallen opponent’s mouth, a sex act that reinforces the power difference between the masculine giver and the feminine receiver (I stress that the masculine and feminine labels refer to one’s role in the sex act, and does not always properly describe the biological sex of either party). By explicitly casting the fallen enemy as the “bottom” and himself as the “top”, the Tea Bag both raises the warrior’s standing among his peers the same as any other bold assertion of masculinity would, and simultaneously humiliates and demoralizes the enemy who is being forcibly pushed down to the lower levels of the social hierarchy.

It is currently unknown whether the Spartans believe the races of the Covenant have identical norms surrounding sex and social hierarchy (which means they believe the meaning of their war dance is perfectly clear) or whether they merely do it for their own edification.",1
1037,"They are an incredibly ancient clan of people who interbred with all kinds of ""freaks"", from witches to werewolves, the undead, mutants, vampires, bigfoot, Deep Ones etc etc, until their DNA is saturated with mixed weirdness.

They stacked so many different magic effects and Soul Pacts on their bloodline that they are basically immortal to all but very special circumstances. When an Addams dies, they often comeback undead or haunt as ghost, because imagine the paperwork to decide who gets to claim their soul?  


Addams are humans only on technicality, they are like 49% supernatural, except they are a mixture of ALL the supernatural which tends to even things out. For example, Gomez and Fester both clearly have Deep One genes in them (which gives them bulging eyes, and hunched posture) but they also have some werewolf in them hence why they have hairy bodies. Cousin It is so hairy because he has Werewolf, Bigfoot, and Yeti genes simultaneously.",1
1038,"Predators have a very strict honor code. It's not an honor code that matches with most human definitions of honor but it's understandable.

They match tools with their prey. It's not a 1 to 1 match and often gets ignored but generally if you have firearms they'll have plasma casters. If you have only your bare hands they'll only fight barehanded. 

They only kill worthy game. Prey that cannot defend itself can't be hunted. Prey that supports other prey such as mothers or guardians can't be hunted either. Sick or grievously injured prey not harmed by the hunter cannot be hunted and must be allowed to heal or even be protected by the hunter until it's healthy enough to be hunted.

Hunting grounds must remain untainted. This is the big one for your question. The hunters cannot allow themselves to be captured or their technology to be captured by lesser species. Doing so is both highly dishonorable and can lead to the prey species wiping itself out or worse becoming a threat to the Yautja as a species. The self destruct is meant to erase all trace of the hunter and preserve the hunting grounds even if it destroys a small portion of it.

No unfair advantages are allowed when hunting. Predators have to decloak themselves when firing their plasmacaster and cannot use their ships or more advanced weapons on prey that cannot match their capabilities. The gear seen used by predators is basically a hunting knife and flintlock rilfe compared to what they have access to on their ships or in their military gear.

There's dozens of rules and edicts they follow when hunting. Some clans have unique rules and others have very few rules. The above are just some major ones. There's rules for special hunts like the blooding rituals and rules for honor hunts and trophy hunts. They have an alien code of honor that doesn't mesh with our modern sensibilities but it's still an honor code.",1

As you said zombies tear appart their victims. This would prevent the person from becoming a zombie because there would not be enough left of him/her to reanimate.

If zombies are so weak untrained starving survivors can take them down then they would have never taken over or spread that far. If they are strong enough to defeat the army then the survivors would stand no change at all as the zombie number increased.

 

I have found an answer to both problems. This would require the zombie making disease to be airborne in order to infect everyone. Then the disease turns everyone into zombies except a small group of people who happen to be immune. This way you can have your zombie horde while the survivors still stand a change.

Unfortunately, only Saruman had a good relationship with men, which he exploited to seize control of Isengard and its Palintir (with which Sauron exert his control over Saruman). Gandalf was manly involved with the Elves and Hobbits (specifically Bilbo and his ring) and his interactions with Men was often luke warm. The other Istari did not factor into the stories of Men (or at least not the Men of the West).

So there really wasn't anyone save Gondor to deal with Sauron, and that was a gradually losing battle.",1

The next big push was the Invasion of New York, which showed him that there was a much bigger universe and larger threats.  His reaction was the Ultron Project, this required a significant work but also ended up being a major failure.

I'm thinking dining, like the 4 star $2000 a plate kind.  That would be profitable.  It is unique enough to draw tourists in for a once in a lifetime experience at a discounted rate (for the older blimps that are not THE new vessel)

All the real estate with a good view is taking.  Have a fancy date, go on thee hour blimp tour of the sparking city.  It looks pretty, from high above, in the dark.  Like the restaurant with the view of Niagra Falls that rotates over 2 hours to give everyone dining continually new view of everything.

Makes a literal good symbol of the rich and powerful being above everyone else, the poverty, the crime, the little people down their with small lives, their laws, everything.  Clearly Organized crime is involved in security so pulling anything there is is Joker crazy as far as the rogues gallery is involved; which is why we've not seen a situation up there.  Lack of petty crime means Batman doesn't visit either.

I'm thinking Bruce only goes there when he absolutely has to and had some high-tech concealed means of egress.  Or perhaps has a Batsuit stored in one of the security safes at each  Restaurant.  I fact, it Wayne enterprises owns a good chunk of the stock or handles security be may get it in no-questioned asked.  Like a diplomatic package.

&#x200B;

All this might make for a great looking comic or fan-fic for when something finally *does* go down on one of the blimps.  Not necessarily a conventional crime.  A serious mechanical problem could be as action packed and act as an out-of-the-batsuit adventure.

They use the teen sidekicks as a public image stunt.  Anytime Robin or Batgirl show up, you’re probably just dealing with a short cop in disguise.

The Dark Dimension is an amalgamation of all the dimensions and realities that Dormammu has successfully taken over. So the laws of physics and quantum mechanics are completely under his utter control and also an amalgamation of all the other dimensions he's absorbed.


To illustrate this, let's assume time moves linearly for us in some measurable way of the time it takes a electron swarm is some hydrogen atom to complete 1,000,000 orbits or something somewhat constant. In another dimension that same second of time takes 10,000,000 orbits or in another it takes 5.



All of these dimensions smash into each other with competing fundamental laws of physics and Dormammu basically asserts his will over them when he wants. He doesn't want time to move, then it doesn't. Or it does in one area and not at all in another.



The physics of the Dark Dimension are basically whatever Dormammu wants. Only when Strange comes to negotiate he brings along an immutable time loop which Dormammu cannot control. 


Dormammu is also a primordial force. He's basically a force of nature on a cosmic scale with a will, an ego, and not much else. Being a promordial force comes with a lot of power, but also not a lot of intellect. You can't reason with a hurricane or a tornado.

1139,"Let's say Mr. Incredible was the kind of deep thinker it takes to recognise that most 11-year-olds don't invent functional rocket boots. Buddy becomes his sidekick, helps him subdue Bomb Voyage, and becomes the guest of honour at the wedding. Then it's time for the newly-forged team - The Incredibles - to hit the streets.

Straight away Mr. Incredible is airborne, he's throwing homing beacons. Six months down the line he's got drone support, he's got AI analysing crime patterns, profiling supercriminals. He's Superman plus Batman. A year down the line there's no questioning it, he's unstoppable, his effectiveness enhanced to the point of being significant on a geopolitical scale. 

A big lawsuit looked like being a problem for a while, but the case went away before reaching trial when the plaintiff was himself the ironic victim of supercrime - one day he was found in his locked apartment *turned inside out*. Horrifically, it appeared that whichever supervillain did this had ingeniously contrived to keep him alive in this state for at least several minutes.

The lawsuit wouldn't have mattered anyway, because before it could have come to trial, Mr. Incredible and Incrediboy were already indispensable. The perfect combination of brawn and brains meant they had rounded up and defeated the nation's supervillains in the first six months, and soon the technologically-enhanced Mr. Incredible was ready to respond to a trouble spot anywhere in the world within minutes, dropping from a custom-designed sub-orbital rocket in a suit of flying battle armour that would have made him almost unstoppable even without his superpowers. 

But more importantly, technology sharing has thrown the US military forward generations in just a few years. Incredibles tech quickly makes DARPA irrelevant. As long as the military technology tap is turned on, Mr. Incredible is untouchable. Other lawsuits come, for other supers, and soon they're relocated or driven underground, but the Incredibles go on, given special protection in legislation, making them something like a cross between a government agency and a Top Secret special operations command.

Mr. Incredible is happy. Maybe he works a little too much, sure. Being the first line of response for the world's greatest superpower to any global wrong is a heady drug for a man like him. Nonetheless, Helen is happy, too, and with the security of an almost crime-free society and  Mr. Incredible's government salary (in the neighbourhood of $500,000 a year), the timeline of their children being born is significantly accelerated, with Violet, Dash and Jack all born within 18 months of one another. Soon Helen is as deeply sunk in domestic bliss as Bob is in his globetrotting adventures, which after all, rarely last more than a day or so.

Incrediboy is less satisfied. While he came to this life seeking glory and adventure, it had quickly become obvious that he was a hundred times more valuable in the laboratory or using the Incrediputer to analyse threats than in the field, and he was soon strongly discouraged from talking to the press when it became clear just how important he would be to national security. And the salary which seems so lavish to Bob and Helen is small beer to him, as he watches multiple billion-dollar startups flourish by aping his innovations.

It's been ten years. Mr. Incredible receives a call to respond to a terrorist incident in Colombia. FARC guerillas, after being driven underground and to the edge of extinction five years ago, have reemerged and seized control of a former military installation in Bogota, taking dozens of hostages. High resolution, multi-layer scans from Incrediboy's network of cheap, high-performance mini-satellites indicate they have only small arms, and the hostages are held in a single location without booby-traps. The plan is simple, drop straight in, backed by a team of SEALbots, maximum force and momentum to deactivate all hostiles before a shot is fired. They're overhead and launching into their attack drop within the hour. 

But the drop doesn't go as planned, the scans were wrong. Instead of primitive AK-74s and RPG-7s, the guerillas are using anti-air electronic counter-measure turrets and swarming explosive drones. Few of the SEALbots survive the descent, none last more than thirty seconds on the ground. Mr. Incredible's battle armour is shutdown in midair. Luckily, he manages to aim for a sewer line that runs through the centre of the drop zone, using the momentum of the fallings tons of dead metal to smash through the few feet of concrete and packed gravel protecting the pipe. Using his old skills, he's able to stealthilty defeat the guerillas, free the hostages, and gracefully accept the Colombian government's offer of a first-class ticket home. Honestly, though, the low-penetration shrapnel of the swarming anti-personnel drones used by the guerillas were never likely to have been particularly effective against him, he was probably never in any real danger.

Incrediboy, though is baffled and disturbed. No one they've faced has been so well-equipped. No one else has ever managed to find the flaws in his tech these ECM turrets have. Clearly, there's some other super-genius inventor selling tech on the open market. He insists on accompanying Mr. Incredible on following missions, where they increasingly face advanced technology - never so advanced that Incrediboy can't engineer a way around them, though.

The arms race continues, and Mr. Incredible increasingly finds himself sidelined. He spends as much time batting attackers away from Incrediboy as he works his magic from a field tech-post as he does resolving situations himself.

Eventually, marginalised by Incrediboy from the field work, Mr. Incredible decides to do some investigation. Surely no one could be selling so much technology without making waves. No one makes a billion dollars without spending a few million, and whoever's supplying the people the Incredibles have been fighting has made *at least* that. He tries running one of Incrediboy's first innovations, an AI program that parses global wealth flows for illegal activity. It was designed for a world with a vast and complex black economy, and it had performed admirably. In this new world the Incredibles have created, there's much less noise, and only one big, flashing red signal - a global arms and technology operation, an enormous red pustule of corruption extending tentacles to nodes around the globe. And who's behind it? Mr. Incredible thinks perhaps he'd known all along.

You see, if we conclude that Buddy wouldn't have become an evil psychopath, we're saying that people are nothing but the result of their environment, and have no moral culpability. I mean, really, in the original timeline, his hero let him down one time. So the fuck what? You know what sort of shit people come through, and then manage to *not* become arms dealers who murder dozens of people in a quest to fulfill petty fantasies?

No, Buddy was bad, and eventually, that was going to come out. He was never going to be content with true heroism, or keep his inventions to only worthy uses, or remain loyal to his hero and mentor.

Mr. Incredible knows what he has to do, so he rushes to the ready room and dons his battle armour. He's climbing into a deployment tube, when he's suddenly rocked by a detonation and blinding white pain. Totally unfamiliar with the deep and crippling feeling of actual injury, he collapses and passes out.

When he comes back to his senses, at least two hours have passed. And Incrediboy is there, bristling with tech, painted in the black-and-white scheme he'd been affecting lately. He's been asking to be called Syndrome, although of course after ten years with one name, Mr. Incredible has been slow to adjust.

Syndrome explains that the pain Mr. Incredible is feeling is the result of special explosive fragmentation compartments installed in the battle armour, installed as failsafes for just such a day. The armour is locked with zero-point energy, an invention Syndrome had thus far kept to himself, rendering Mr. Incredible unable to move even if his injuries were less severe. Syndrome says the anatomical monitoring devices installed in the armour show that shrapnel has ruptured Mr. Incredible's bowels, penetrated his kidneys, and reached his spine. If it weren't for his unusual super resilience, he'd have died within minutes. As it is, Syndrome will be obliged to perform a coup de grâce. But first, he makes sure Mr. Incredible knows that the same trigger that detonated the fragmentation compartments and froze the armour also despatched a team of SEALbots to wipe out the Parr family home.

Broken, Mr. Incredible asks why. Outraged that it's not obvious, Syndrome launches into a diatribe about how he was mistreated and abused, how he was kept from the limelight and paid a pittance.

Ten minutes later, Syndrome keels over. Helen, Violet, Dash and Jack have arrived. Unaffected by the prohibition on super activity, the kids have developed their powers to a much higher degree than they otherwise would have, and easily defeated the SEALbots. Violet had long ago realised that as a last resort she could open a forcefield in someone's brain. She didn't even need to enter the ready room as Syndrome speechified, nor did she hesitate, possessed of the remorseless black-and-white morality of a nine-year-old and encouraged by her father's status as unaccountable world policeman.

TL;DR: Bad fan fiction, the same character flaws that made Buddy into Syndrome in the original timeline would have held for all other timelines.",1

1142,"*The term ""Middle-earth"" was not invented by Tolkien. Rather, it comes from Middle English middel-erde, itself a folk-etymology for the Old English word middangeard (geard not meaning Earth, but rather enclosure or place, thus yard, with the Old Norse word miðgarðr being a cognate). It is Germanic for what the Greeks called the οικουμένη (oikoumenē) or ""the abiding place of men"", the physical world as opposed to the unseen worlds (The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, 151).

1145,"I think this is a classic ""ain't no rule"" situation.

The fight was to submission or death, on the waterfall. Killmonger threw him out of the combat arena, but there's no out-of-ring DQ in Wakandan politics.

While the rules explicitly ban performance-enhancing heart-shaped herbs (PEHSH), they apparently say nothing about receiving medical attention mid fight. I suspect that's on the honour system - traditionally, claimants to the Wakandan throne would be men of great integrity, who would treat their opponents with respect, and allow all measures necessary to avoid unnecessary death; as such, they probably thought a ""no first aid during time-outs"" rule would be both needlessly dangerous and unnecessary in all but the most exceptional circumstances.

Zuri Whitaker's intervention was another thing they probably didn't have rules against because it seemed not only unnecessary for there to be such a rule, but necessary that such action should be permitted. Every fight needs a referee, and the referee should be able to say to the fighters: ""Ease up, bro. You're taking it a little far.""

In short, it was kind of a punk move, and classic loophole abuse, but it's really on Killmonger for calling the fight early. T'Challa's later use of PEHSH would normally result in a disqualification, but A) given that his opponent was also rockin' them herbal 'roids, it seems a reasonable measure; and B) since Cousin Eric had murdered the referee, there was nobody to call him on it anyway.

1147,"No, I don't think it's going to suddenly go out and just abandon its trainer to go into construction. It may actually be trying to evolve so it can be more useful around the house.

Here's the thing - Machops are strong and their humanoid build does make them great for social care, but they do have their limitations. A Machop happens to stand at 78.7cm on average and weighs only about 20kg. In Imperial measurements, that's 2 foot and six inches and 44lbs.

A Machoke, however, is significantly larger - 150cm and 70kg, or 4 foot 11 inches and 154lbs. They are also significantly stronger as well and can in fact serve as far better carers as a result, easily being able to carry a full-grown human.

So, my first concern - especially since you mentioned the Machop is caring for your grandmother - is that there may in fact be a significant problem that you haven't noticed, or that the Machop is trying to evolve because it doesn't feel like it's capable of caring for your grandmother in its current form.

Has she been suffering from loss of mobility lately? Is it that she can't actually perform certain tasks for herself and needs the Machop to pick up the slack more and more? Is she being ignored more and more by her human family who aren't able to see any of these other issues?

Or, could it be the other way around? A symptom of growing older is that elders actually lose their impulse control; i.e. they're more likely to speak their mind or do something they would consider shameful in their younger days. For this reason, it may actually be possible, if the Machop actually is considering trying to leave then it may actually be the victim of abuse from your grandmother.

Look into the situation and see if she or the Machop actually needs more help. Don't try and stop the Machop from leaving to go to the gym, at least not yet. But you should try and monitor the situation, maybe by hiding a secret camera somewhere in the house.

Intervention is key, however. Your grandmother's health may be failing, or the Machop could be abused to the point where it will lash out at her. If it does so after evolving, then the damage can be severe.

Something similar happened to an elderly man in my own town, whose own Machop had evolved because the old man needed additional help. But when the old man needed a wheelchair, the local health board assigned a local carer to help him as well - she frequently abused the Machop after he tried to stop her from mistreating the old man, even after it evolved into a Machoke.

Things went horribly wrong when the Machoke evolved again, into a Machamp and decided to become physical against the care worker. Machamps are 160cm/ 5 foot 3 inches, just slightly bigger than a Machoke, but are nearly double the mass at 130kg/286lbs. And it evolved right after the care worker started physically abusing her charge.

I'd recommend immediate intervention because if the situation is already dire, you do not want it to escalate.",1

1156,"I'm going to assume Toto is in Pathfinder.

> I hear the drums echoing tonight / but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation.

Hearing things happening over long distances is a Perception check. Hearing something distant but clear, like drums, over the noise of quiet conversation is probably DC 10 or 12, depending on how far away the drums are and how loud the conversation is.

> It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you / there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.

Escaping a grapple is an opposed CMB/CMD check. Only the 8 nearest men can participate, as none of the hundred men have a weapon with reach (if some of the men have spiked chains or whips, this gets harder for Toto). One of the men initiates the grapple, the rest can each give +2, meaning they have a CMB to initiate the grapple of +14. In order for there to be literally no way (barring a natural 20) they can keep Toto, that means his CMD is at least 34. (CMD = 10 + Base attack bonus + Strength modifier + Dexterity modifier + special size modifier + miscellaneous modifiers.) In order to get his CMD up to 34, he needs 18 strength (+4), 20 dex (+5), and a base attack bonus of +15. Fortunately for us, Cleric, Druid, and Bard -- our three most likely classes, given what Toto does -- all get a BAB of +15 at level 20. By level 20, he's likely also had enough time to increase his stats to that 18 STR 20 DEX threshold; the 20 DEX will also help his acrobatics rolls to move through the threatened squares of the other 92 men that can't get in the initial grapple.

> The wild dogs cry out in the night / as they grow restless longing for some solitary company

Speak with Animals is Druid 1, Bard 3.
> I seek to cure what's deep inside / frightened of this thing that I've become

According to the core rulebook, a Remove Disease or Heal spell cast by a Cleric of 12th level or higher is required to cure Lycanthropy, provided the character receives the spell within 3 days of the infecting attack. If Toto ""seeks to cure"" his condition, it means he probably doesn't have the caster levels to do it himself, pointing to either Bard or Druid. That could also explain why he's stopping old men on the way, hoping to find some old forgotten words, and why he's so excited that she's coming in 12:30 flight -- maybe she's the cleric who can help heal his condition, but she has to rush there to get him that Cure spell within 3 days.

As for Blessing the Rains, that's probably Control Weather, which is a 7th level Druid spell, which Toto will have access to by 13th level.

It seems most likely, given his ability to create classic songs, that Toto has a few levels of Bard, so I'm going to say that he's probably a Human Druid 13 / Bard 7. He's had 5 stat increases, and we know he has 18 STR and 20 DEX in order to protect himself from those hundred men, which means he probably has something like 18 STR, 20 DEX, 10 CON, 10 INT, 16 WIS, 12 CHA.

Odin's father Bor was the All-father (which basically just seems to be the king of the Nine Realms) who had access to a power referred to as the Odinforce nowadays. It's frequently accessed via the spear Gungnir, although that doesn't seem to be required.


The Odinforce is basically just a vast power source that can be used to do magic. In the CU ""Magic"" mostly just translates to ""blasting people"", although in comics it has a much wider range of abilities. After using it enough, Odin gets tired and takes a nice long Odinsleep to recharge. I know that sounds like a joke, but is literally what they call it. It is also different from regular sleep in that he's basically in a coma for a little while.

Basically Bor died, and eventually Odin became the next All-father. Presumably that means Thor is next in line for All-Fatherhood because as far as we can tell it's a hereditary thing. 

Speculatively: The power probably has something to do with Yggdrasil the World Tree, and the Sleep is accessing the Tree's power to recharge the force.

More importantly, tides would cease to function. The moon and the ocean are apush and pull; the moon pulls the ocean back, and the ocean pushes. With the moon gone, the ocean surged. With the ocean gone? I imagine all would be eerily still. Ships would be becalmed, unable to move. Fish would wash up dead, unable to get the nutrients they require. 

The ocean would not disappear, but the ocean would die.

He didn't just want to beat Cap; he wanted him to *know* he was beaten. Hence bringing an army to what had been a single combat.

Then Cap produced an army of his own. But by that time Thanos had committed to the display. He'd put his army out there, and he couldn't hold them back to allow time for a bombardment without admitting that he might have misjudged the situation. Remember, his entire character arc is about being unable to admit that he might be wrong about something. So he orders his army to attack.

Vader is the supreme commander of the Imperial armed forces, superseded only by the Emperor himself.

Grand Moff Tarkin, aside from being a Grand Moff (and perhaps the most senior of them) is also in command of the Death Star, the single most powerful weapon in the galaxy. 

Moffs, however, are much more of a civilian position, as opposed to a military one, so Tarkin has some interesting overlap.

So, there are two likely reasons why Vader listened to Tarkin.

1) Vader was on the Death Star. Tarkin is in command of the Death Star. Therefore, while he's on the Death Star, Vader listens to Tarkin.

2) Vader didn't listen to Tarkin because he had to, but because he wanted to. When Tarkin tells Vader to release Motti, Vader says ""As you wish."" He really doesn't sound like he's doing it because he has been ordered. 

Likewise, Tarkin sounds more like he's just tired of dealing with the petty bickering and brinkmanship when he tells Vader to stop choking out Motti. Vader could have just said ""No, he must learn his lesson,"" and choked out Motti, and Tarkin probably would've just sighed, rolled his eyes, and filled out the paperwork.

Personally, I think it's a bit of both. Vader knows that, on the Death Star, Tarkin is in charge. Coupled with the decades of working together, Vader had a respect for Tarkin which he held for few others, and is more likely to listen to Tarkin over most others.",1

Also Slytherin house isn't really alone in being capable of producing bad wizards.

So then the guy sitting at the bus stop starts talking to you.

A lot of the answers below go into the logistics of grabbing jedi/force sensitive kids, or the hurdles they must go through to be converted into inquisitors.  All of this misses the core point of *why* Palpatine did it.  

To manipulate him.  Which is what he'd been doing for almost the entirety of his life.  

He didn't 'need' Anakin to go back to the temple and start slaughtering his fellows in the sense that he needed the manpower, or Anakin's abilities, to get it done.  What he did need was a guilt and rage fueled monster by his side who would do whatever he said, whenever he said it, without hesitation or compunction.  

So he manipulated him.  Appealing to his sense of 'duty to the Republic,' Palpatine sent him there to baptize his new apprentice *in blood.*  

Up to that point, Anakin had only committed one truly unforgivable sin in his life - the slaughter of the sand people that tortured and murdered his mother.  It was something he did in the heat of rage, and something that haunted him for the rest of his life.  It was something he specifically spoke about to Palpatine, and which Papa Palps *reminded* him about while they were at the opera.  To really get his new apprentice off to a running start, Palpatine needed him to face the same situation without hesitation, and without even the hint of valid justification.   He needed Anakin to become a *murderer.*  Because, once he did, serving Palpatine would be the only path left for him, and it would fill him with rage enough for a lifetime.

He has incredible strength, is virtually indestructible, flight, speed (not a ton, but fast), some heightened senses, and laser eyes. 

What he doesn't have is everything amped up and the ability to 'share' in the odd ways Superman does his abilities (the only way he can fly people around at supersonic speeds and not kill them) or to lift planes.

Think of it this way: a guy with JUST strength and invulnerability somehow gets in position to lift a car or an elephant. Where do you lift it to not damage or hurt it? Superman kinda... spreads his Thing and this allows him to do it. In some versions his 'field' of some sort does this. It's logical within him because it's always worked that way. That's why he can do crazy stuff. 

Homelander is closer to but *far* below adult Viltrumites, except they don't have laser eyes. No Viltrumite could just pick up a cargo ship. It would split in half from all that concentrated pressure. He *could* drag it by a giant chain if the chain was secured right and its force distributed properly. 

So overall, no. Homelander had one chance to save the flight: save the pilot(s) and kill the bad guy without nuking the entire cockpit. He hesitated, the pilots were dead, and then there's a chance he could have with help brought the plane down. Once the cockpit was obliterated, no chance.",1

3. At the Battle of Coruscant, Palpatine egged Skywalker into killing Dooku. ""*He's too dangerous to be kept alive*"". (This is a very important phrase that comes up later.) That was the ""justification"" given by Palpatine on why he ordered Anakin to kill. And from the time that Anakin was ordered to spy on the Chancellor, Palpatine has been telling Anakin over and over again. The only difference between the Jedi and the Sith is that the Sith was more open about it.

4. Anakin has been ""loved"" unconditionally as a son by Palpatine. The Council took Anakin for granted. Obi-Wan, the last person he's attached to in the Jedi Order isn't there to help his dilemma, tasked to take down Grevious, the last remaining Supreme Leader of the CIS. 

5. Then comes the fateful night, Palpatine reveals to Anakin that he was the Sith Lord all along. That he alone have the power to save Padme. Anakin, still loyal to the Jedi Order, leaves and informs the Council. Mace Windu trusts Anakin about Palpatine, assembles the best Bladesmasters available to confront and apprehend the Supreme Chancellor. He doesn't bring Anakin, probably not trusting Anakin to help as he was too emotionally close to Palpatine.


6. Anakin, blinded by his worry of Padme's foreseen death and Palpatine's promise, went the Chancellor's office. There, the aftermath of the battle. He didn't see how Palpatine killed 2 Jedi Masters in a heartbeat. He didn't see how much effort Mace Windu had to exert just to defeat him. He just saw one of the strongest Jedi Master holding one of his father figures at saber length.

7. Anakin begs Windu to take Palpatine in alive. He's disarmed. He's weak. He's evil but he still is alive to be interrogated to extract the knowledge that Palpatine has to save Padme.

1276,"> If a Potion Master and a muggle chemistry master worked together, could they do anything either couldn't do alone?

Maybe? To expand on u/MjBlack's idea, the Wizard World seems to rely on tradition, experience, and passed-down knowledge in almost every avenue of study. 

The Scientific Method simply isn't in their vernacular, and even the most forward thinking, cutting-edge Wizards seem to rely more on observation of the natural world and learning long-lost secrets than on simple experimentation or even trial and error.

While it's easy to see how introducing the Scientific Method to the Wizarding World *could* cause an unprecedented magical boon as entire research facilities are opened up to develop new magic, I think there's a reason that magical research and development isn't already common: Magic is DANGEROUS and UNPREDICTABLE. Uttering a syllable wrong or even thinking of the wrong memory during a spell can be the difference between a healing potion or a landmine-sized explosion. It takes a lot of discipline to use even basic magic safely, and one person's happy memory may be ""happier"" than another's, making strict testing near impossible. 

Hence, the vast majority of Wizards tend to use tried-and-true, oft-repeated magic. Only the most disciplined minds, the greatest wizards of all time ever try to create anything new. And even then, it's generally safer and more reliable to either (1) discover something that's already been discovered, just lost to time or (2) already exists in the natural magical world and hasn't been understood and replicated by Wizards.",1
1277,"I think you are misunderstanding the usage of the word ""safest"" to mean ""least accidental danger"" in a context where it really means ""most protected from intentional harm.""

A good analogy to this would be a muggle's firearm. Muggles frequently accidentally injure and kill themselves and others with firearms all the time. In general they are extremely dangerous. If you put 30 teenagers in a room with 30 firearms, there is significant more danger to those teenagers than if the firearms were not there, provided there is nothing outside that is trying to attack. 

But if there are velociraptors (according to what we can find on the muggle ""internet"" these are a common muggle  threat) trying to attack the teenagers, a room with 30 firearms is much ""safer"" than the room with no firearms. 

The muggle equivalent to the safety of Gringotts would be Fort Knox, which is specifically set up to be safe for storing things. Finding a muggle equivalent to Hogwarts is more difficult, since the Muggles often do not have an equivalent school. However, the reason that Hogwarts is so safe is a mixture of having the most powerful Wizard in the world in residence, the other powerful wizards, who teach, and some historical levels of safety. So I would say that the best equivalent in the Muggle world would be the White House, or the Pentagon. 

And I could absolutely see someone saying ""Fort Knox is the safest place to keep something you don't want taken, except perhaps the White House"". But neither of these are inherently safe compared to a kindergarten classroom.",1

Zemo: Tony Stark and/or Steve Rogers are killed, to be shortly followed by half the universe at the hands of - you guessed it, he's big, he's purple, and there's clearly something going on with his chin - Thanos.

Dormammu: The world is consumed. Suffering is all. Dormammu is all. Time is meaningless. Only agony endures. On the plus side, Thanos isn't going to get his hands on the Time Stone in a hurry. Really, Dr Strange should have looked at the big picture and sacrificed the lives and souls of everyone on Earth for the greater good (the Greater Good).

In other situations, though, Scott really does demonstrate his limits.  He confuses a gas truck for a water truck in the airport fight.  He immediately falls flat in a science discussion with Tony.  He's an 'idiot' who tries to eat tacos near a landing zone.  He wastes Pym particles.  Basically, there's a lot of steps where he shows that he's maybe not functioning at quite the same level as the others.

Event of GotG:

Quill wakes up with the Orb on hand, but far after the OT (original timeline).  
So Korath and his men are already here.   
I suppose the fight would be nearly the same as the OT, and Quill would flee in the Milano and try to sell it on Xandar.

Without Gamora, Quill only has to fight Groot and Rocket, but he's as underpowered as the OT. The 3 of them are detained in the Kyln.

There, they wouldn't meet Drax, who meets Gamora because of Thanos, Ronan, blablabla.  
Rocket's plan of evasion would still work, because Quill would fill Gamora's role, and the 3 of them would evade.

But, instead of going to Taneleer Tivan (Gamora's idea), they would have another plan.

I don't really know what will happen after that, but either Ronan find and kill them, or they are killed during the battle of Xandar, because Quill is foolish and stubborn and won't survive without his ninja girlfriend, or they will disband and mind their own business.

Aftermath of Gardians of the Galaxy

* Xandar is destroyed and Ronan possess the Power Stone.
* The Gardians never really assemble, and are either dead or don't care about other than themselves.

GotG 2:

If Quill is dead or absent from the Battle of Xandar, Ego will never hear of him.  
He won't search him, he won't try to conquer the universe... for now.

Event of Infinity War:

* Thanos never attack the Statesman (Thor's ship)
* Thor will land to Earth and establish New Asgard in Norway.

Variables:

* Ronan has the Power Stone. He might want to seek revenge on Captain Marvel.
* Taneleer Tivan still has the Reality Stone. He might want to collect the other 5.
* Vision keeps the Mind Stone.
* Loki keeps the Space Stone, without Thor knowing.
* Dr Strange keeps the Time Stone.

1299,"In terms of the Republic and the Empire, Coruscant likely served as the central timekeeper for political and military purposes, effectively a ""Coruscant Mean Time"" (CMT) much the way Greenwich Mean Time is used as a general time marker. Each planet would use their own time for their internal business, but when you'd set your schedules with other planets you'd use CMT to make sure everyone's using the same time. 

For travelers on ships, there's a few different ways they can do it. Either A) they can gently mess with the lights and timing during transit so by the time they arrive at their destination they're on the same rotation as the destination or B) maintain ""ship's time"" independent from their destination, set either from their port of origin or by CMT. The former is likely only done by smaller vessels, or by small non-crew groups on larger ships, effectively letting them cheat on ""hyperdrive lag"" in acclimating to the new rotation. The latter is more common with larger commercial and military vessels, as keeping to a strict, universal time table is often critical to operations and the individual comfort of the crew/passengers.

Regarding biological differences, it pretty much came down to ""go on human timing or go F yourself"". Even in the arguably more egalitarian Republic days, humanity had a dominant role in government and military, and when it comes time to get everyone to compromise on a schedule it's a human majority influencing the timing. Any species that couldn't hang with that timing was effectively handicapped, in turn further reducing their ability to influence the timetables and leading to a cycle where it was chiefly humans and human-equivalents making the calls on the schedule. In the Empire, which was a straight up human supremacist, this only got worse.

As far as the biorhythm of Jedi, they likely have techniques to get themselves on the schedule of new planets in rapid order; meditation, carefully timed resting to realign their sleep schedules, opening themselves to the local flow of life energy, that ""fists with your toes"" thing John McClane does, you know, whatever works.",1

Most of them were taken care of, but a chunk went off into the unknown regions to form the first order and rebuild. 

While the First Order rebuilt, the New Republic was sorta getting its footing. They decided to demilitarize since they wanted to encourage peace as much as possible after the civil war, and didn’t think they had any real threats they needed a military for. Leia and the people who went on to form the resistance didn’t agree. They knew the First Order was out there and a threat, but once word got out Leia was Vader’s daughter, a lot of the New Republic stopped trusting her. So she went off to start up the resistance to do what the Republic would not while the New Republic continued to demilitarize. 

Then the FO came out and obliterated the central government of the New Republic and all that was left really was scattered local militaries and the resistance.

1329,"Hi. As a loyalist of our Galactic Republic please allow me to answer your concerns you have with the Jedi Order.


First of all, they do not exactly take kids aways from parents. As far as I’m aware the entire thing is completely voluntary on the parents part. But please do correct me if I’m wrong. There is also a reason for their actions, an untrained force user is a danger in certain circumstances. The Jedi take them in young in order to raise them in an environment allowing proper training and control and letting them put their abilities to good use.


I will concede that at times young Jedi can act like what is essientsly a child soldier. But it has to be remembered they are not normal children, they are in tune with the living force. And outside of times of active conflict I wouldn’t be surprised if most combat was handled by more experimental adult Jedi. Jedi are diplomats and monks as well.


The reason I imagine the Jedi get rid of personal love is that they ideally do not wish their members becoming attached to anyone in particular. A true Jedi should feel compassion and love for all life, not prioritising someone based off of personal connection at the expense of others. 


Of course this hasnene acknowledges even by some Jedi has one of their order’s paradoxes.


Also a Jedi is perfectly able to leave. Count Dooku left the order peacefully and to no ill will I believe. So if a Jedi decides they wish to leave then there is nothing stopping the rule wise.


The Jedi your friend met may seem aggressive. But keep in mind that the Jedi are some of the most elite and powerful individuals who answer to the senate, even in peace times their missions would likely often have high stakes. Even if that particular Jedi came off as arrogant and aggressive, you don’t know what mission they had. Many Jedi are also different, each width different personalities and approaches to their duties. You even note that Master Obi-Wan was a chill guy.


Their actions against the Sith may have been harsh and could even argued to be one of their most questionable decisions. But keep in mind that the Sith are also a violent power hungry cult which  brought chaos and destruction to the galaxy and continually attempted to destroy the old republic. The fact that so much of the galaxy is able to live under a free democratic republic and not as slaves of the Sith can likely be owed to the Jedi and their actions in defending the republic from countless Sith incursions.


Jedi can only suggest things and it works best on the weak minded and those used to following order. While it is questionable they don’t appear to abuse it and many would be able to resist it anyway, some are even immune. The power exists regardless of if the Jedi use it anyway.


The temple on coruscant is presumably provided by the tax payer through funding from the senate. I doubt they have much of their own wealth outside of relics they are unlikely to part with. 


The Jedi are peacekeepers who have protected the republic for over a thousand generations. They saw the republic through a thousand year period of peace and have served the senate faithfully and loyalty.


The Jedi is not responsible for providing hot meals and places of sleep, there are already far too few of them. Those services would He the domain of social services brought in by the senate.


The Jedi are diplomats and peacekeepers who maintain the republic’s law and peace throughout all systems loyal to our democracy.

The Iron Man armor is able to out-fly and out-fight modern American military jets. Let's ballpark the cost of a suit at around [65-100 million USD](https://www.aerotime.aero/27553-Top-10-most-expensive-fighter-jets-in-2021). Intuitively, this seems a fair comparison; Tony would save on R&D costs compared to a fighter jet, because it's just him and his AI, but he also uses exotic materials that are harder to come by.

He's built fifty of the Iron Man armors, so we'll estimate the cost of his suits alone at **four billion dollars**. We'll lump the War Machines and Time Heist suits into this, since a few million here or there doesn't really impact such a large number.

He also funded the Avengers Tower and Upstate headquarters. In NYC, a skyscraper costs about [15 million USD per floor](https://buildingtheskyline.org/skyscraper-height-iv/), and if we guess Stark Tower was [about 75 stories high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_New_York_City), that's another **one billion dollars**. Let's guess that the Upstate Campus also cost **one billion**; it's cheaper land and construction, but much larger and more advanced.

Now, let's estimate the cost of the Pym/Stark Time Travel device. This is a complete ass-pull, but let's compare it to a similarly complex physics experiment, the [Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider), which cost about **nine billion USD**.

That gives us a ballpark total of **fifteen billion USD**. This is an absolutely huge amount of money, but something well within the capabilities of a Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, and Tony is probably far richer than either.

However, Bruce explains that if they bring it back, the timeline will continue on more or less normally since they have their infinity stone back. The BIG thing to note is that this actually doesn't literally merge the 2012's timeline back into the prime timeline, but the visual of the dark timeline merging back into the main timeline was more or less a metaphor to show that once they have the infinity stone back, things will go how they were supposed to ie how things happened in the prime timeline 2012 onwards. 

Captain America goes back to the 40s to be with Peggy, and this creates a branching timeline. It's possible that this timeline is radically different from our prime timeline, but whatever the case, he is able to use a time machine from his alternate timeline to jump back forwards into our prime timeline, 5 seconds after his original self left. So the timeline in which he lives his life with Peggy is different from the one the original heroes are from.

1356,"I believe that the first Muslim astronaut went up to the ISS a decade or so ago, and I remember reading that he was advised to make his best effort to face towards the projection of where Mecca is on Earth, or if not possible, just to try to face Earth in general.  It's also  normal for anyone praying on moving transportation, like an airplane, to face in the generally right direction, and then not to worry about changes in direction past that point.

So I'd assume the same thing would apply post-interstellar colonization.  An observant Muslim would do their best to face Earth or the Sol system (or at least the Milky Way, if distant enough), and work from there.",1
1357,"Well for starters the Milky Way DOES exist, its just far, far away from the GFFA.

Now as for your question, it is technically theoretically possible to travel from the GFFA to the Milky Way. In fact, there is limited extra galactic travel already in the world of Star Wars. The Rishi Maze is an irregular dwarf galaxy locked to the main galaxy. It is where Kamino was located and can be seen in the ending of ESB. 

Now as for traveling to other major galaxies, like mentioned, it is theoretically possible but there are some caveats.

Galaxies are orders of magnitude further apart than stars, and while Hyperspace ""shortens"" the distance it would still take a massive amount of time and energy. A ship would have to be able to carry enough supplies, especially enough Coaxium, to keep the Hyperdrives working. It would be a very difficult and expensive endeavor, but again, technically possible.

The second, and more salient point is that a Hyperspace route would need to have been plotted ahead of time. You can't just aim a ship at a direction and jump into Hyperspace,  well you can, but as Han so elegantly pointed out, that is how you crash into something and die. A route with jump points and coordination with obstacles and disturbances, all which are in motion, needs to exist to travel safely. In the past, this was done by explorers who made micro jumps, recorded data, compiled them, and essentially made maps. A very time consuming, expensive, and dangerous endeavor.

It could theoretically be done between galaxies, but the thing is no one knows just what is in between. There are ribbons of dark matter, energy, and who knows what else. All of that would have to be mapped, and it would take eons upon eons of time. Again, theoretically possible but crazy difficult and expensive to do. It wouldn't be the work of a generation, entire civilizations would rise, fall, others rise in their place, only to rise and fall themselves in a countless series before the work could be done, making it very hard to fund such an endeavor.

There is also one final point. Legend has it that there is a Hyperspace disturbance that surrounds the galaxy, maybe all galaxies, making it nearly impossible to cross the threshold. The Rishi Maze is essentially a satellite of the GFFA that the disturbances have all but disappated between the two, but who knows with any other galaxy. If one is even able to leave the GFFA, there is no guarantee that one could find their way into another.",1

However, it didn't even produce a strong enough charge to create sparks. On top of that, Volta had a flawed understanding of how his own battery worked, assuming that the current was a result of two different materials coming into contact with one another. The true nature of the current was in the chemical reaction that was being produced.

Stark's miniature arc reactor is so far ahead of the original, both in design and in supporting scientific theory, that the two simply can't be compared.

Judges taking bribes is a big deal, and a Judge getting caught doing it is catching a brutal sentence; 20 years minimum on an off-world penal colony with an atmosphere so harsh they need to surgically alter people to breath. Corrupt Judges tend to rapidly become desperate and dangerous if they fear getting caught, and with the power they have they can ruin your life in a heartbeat. A crooked Judge is capable of virtually anything, and is a threat to your well-being not to be taken lightly.

Your best shot is going to be to drop an anonymous tip somewhere outside the Judge's immediate jurisdiction. Contact the next precinct over, and inform them of the name of the Judge, and the exact location and time of the bribe. From there, two units get involved; the Public Surveillance Unit (PSU) and the Special Judicial Squad (SJS).

The PSU controls every piece of monitoring equipment in the city, and if the Judge did their deal in a public (or even many private) spaces, they have a hi-def video of it. Of course, an entire Mega-City wired for picture and sound means an insanely high noise/signal ratio, hence why it's critical for them to know there's something to look for, and for you to be as precise as possible to give them the best chance of finding the right needle in their legendary pile of needles. 

The SJS is the Internal Affairs department, ""the Judges who judge the Judges"". Their power to fuck up a Judge's life equals or exceeds the power a Judge has over a random citizen; they can (and will) force entry on a Judge's living quarters unannounced, pump them full of truth serum, and interrogate the hell out of them, not because of any accusations but *just at random*. Of course, this much power in the hands of a small group, ironically, is itself ripe for cultivating corruption, and the SJS has become crooked in the past. Ironically, this works in your favor, since the SJS needs to keep booking, cooking, and incarcerating actually corrupt Judges both to preserve their sweet position in the organization and to point the finger at someone other than themselves.

Also, while it may be difficult for us to imagine finding something dumped in the ocean the magic world has shown that they have very precise methods of detecting magic of varying kinds - even when otherwise unknown. Think of detecting underage magic use, or the mirrors which detect enemies based on proximity and a whole host of other things. Without defences there’s always a risk if someone goes hunting them. 

Lastly there’s the possibility of someone working out where they’re dumped non magically. Yes, a random scattering my seem pragmatic but, given nobody knows who Voldemort truly is, he has done a really good job in hiding them. An inaccessible cave with an enchanted lake hidden out of sight on a storm blighted cliffside is as obscured as can be to be honest and only hinted at if you know Voldemort’s life story better than anyone could be reasonably be expected to know.

* 2: Independent Source Doctrine. If the police acquire illegal evidence, but also obtain the same evidence through an independent, legal means, the evidence is admissible.

EDIT: Follow-up. We know that Batman works with the police. So whether Batman is truly acting in the commission of a 'private person' is up for debate. If Batman broke into a house for unrelated reasons, and reported the ensuing Meth Lab he found, that would probably be fine. If Commissioner Gordon directs Batman towards a suspect whose house Batman then searches, then there can be a reasonable question about whether Batman is acting in a 'private' capacity, or a 'public' capacity.

The world that the Machines created inside the Matrix is a world that is meant to appear in and around the technological capabilities of 1999.

As you may know, the Matrix is inherently unstable and requires to be reset every so often. These cycles are about 100 years in length, and we know that there have been at least 6 cycles.

The Machines want humanity inside the Matrix to think and act a certain way, and they have deduced that the easiest way to control humanity inside is through this era of technological advances. People have computers and cell phones. The internet exists but is limited and not as easy or as comprehensive as in our time. People can get and spread communication, but it is easier for the Machines to monitor and curate. Any glitches or incursions from those outside the Matrix are easily contained, and humanity is led to believe what the Machines want them to believe.

In order to keep this status quo, the Machines created the idea that the technology of the world of the Matrix is peak advancement. Oh there will be small changes and advancements added over the years, but they are few and far between and change little of the capabilities humanity can access.

So its not always the year 1999, the dates on the calender do change, but for those inside the Matrix it is a century or so where 1999 is as advanced as we get. And when the only information anyone can receive is curated by the Machines, it is an easy lie to make people believe. The Machines make it so that any advancement is impossible, and anyone who bucks that belief are either quietly disappeared by the Agents long before they can get their ideas out due to the technological limits in place, or if they are lucky, extracted by Zion.

It is also important to remember, even what the people outside in Zion believe is information that is heavily curated by the Machines, they only know what the Machines allow them to know, as part of their system of control. Remember, the Machines are not on our side, they are not there to secretly keep us going for our own sake.

1440,"The nature of godhood in Greece versus The Nine Realms. In Greece the gods are intrinsically tied to their domains. They are effectively metaphysical representations of what they represent - to kill them kills the thing they are linked to. They built reality around themselves and are the world itself. Ares is not just the one who’s the best at war but he is the very idea, the very concept of war itself. Poseidon doesn’t just control or rule the seas, they are as much him as he is them.

Meanwhile the Aesir, incredibly powerful as they are, aren’t as intrinsically tied to the domains they’re gods of. Their domains are more their nature and power, which aligns with some aspect of the world. In GOW18 they specifically say they’ll learn what Atreus’s abilities will be as they develop. The Norse Gods are, not to diminish their power, immensely powerful immortals, but they are not the same metaphysical beings the Greek Gods are. They’re simply at echelons of power where it only *matters* at beings of comparable power.

When Kratos killed Helios the skies went dark because the idea of The Sun was just killed. But killing Thor doesn’t kill the idea of the storm, of thunder. He’s empowered by it, he can control it, he can use and influence the storm - but he is not *the storm itself*.",1

There is precedent where if someone is here while their home nation is dissolved, they can not be deported back, because the nation they came from does not exist anymore.

Imagine a refugee arrived here from Czechoslovakia in 1992, but then it dissolves and splits into the Czech Republic and Slovakia 6 months later. Neither new nation recognizes the refugee as a citizen, and we literally can not send them back to Czechoslovakia.

In Superman's case: Krypton is gone. Even if he were willing to leave or go along with it, he literally can not be deported back. Now, that doesn't mean he would be given citizenship. Just that he likely would be allowed to remain in in the US.

1486,"You remember the Architect? The Colonel Sanders looking guy who is the embodiment of [sesquipedalian loquaciousness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesquipedalianLoquaciousness)?

Turns out he addresses your core issue here. I imagine most people just kind of drone out over most of his speech, and it is unfortunate that they had this information given in perhaps the most arcane manner possible. Exposition drops are bad enough as it is, but it's almost as if they didn't want people paying attention. Anyway, here are some relevant bits:

>*""Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix. You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision.""*

Remember that the machines do not, fundamentally, understand humans. The first version of the Matrix was a paradise that almost everyone rejected, to their own demise. The 1999 version isn't perfect either. While it contents most people, you still have those that ""wake up"" from it, even on their own. To address one of your questions: ""Why don't they 'patch' it?"" They're trying, but despite their efforts to counter-act the emergence of ""The One"", he still appears. In fact, they shifted from solely trying to prevent his occurrence, to anticipating it and attempting to control it when it appears:

>*""While it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it, it is not unexpected, and thus not beyond a measure of control. Which has led you, inexorably, here.""*

Ok, but is this satisfactory? I mean seems simple. If you want humans to have a max speed, cap their speed. If you don't want them to be able to fly, don't give them the ability to fly. What gives?

Well, remember that the entire point of the Matrix is to create an environment where humans can exist, and the first attempt failed. Success required an understanding of humans that eluded the machines:

>*""The first matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art, flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being, thus I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche.""*

""The Oracle""

Her sole purpose was to understand humans, which perhaps resulted in her seemingly prescient abilities to ""predict"" their behavior and, thus, the future.

Her solution?

>*""\[S\]he stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99.9% of all test subjects accepted the program, as long as they were given a choice, even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level.""*

Free Will. Humans need some element of Free Will. That limits the ability of the machines to cap their powers.^(\*) Successive application of free will, at an unconscious level, however can, over time, lead to the ""exploits"" we see:

>*""While this answer functioned, it was obviously fundamentally flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly, that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo, those that refused the program, while a minority, if unchecked, would constitute an escalating probability of disaster.""*

Thus the machines are in a situation where they need to allow for this imperfection to ensure the viability of the Matrix as a whole, but this imperfection, compounded over time, results in the emergence of ""The One"" that threatens the system. Yet this emergence is predictable. Rather than try to prevent it, they exploit it:

>*""The function of the One is now to return to the source... After which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals, 16 female, 7 male, to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix, which coupled with the extermination of Zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.""*

Basically the Matrix *allows* Zion to exist as extortion material to force ""The One"" to basically reset everything. In short, when the problem of ""The One"" gets out of hand, they rebuild everything from scratch (which is why the Matrix is seemingly always in the late 1990s).

\* - It perhaps bears expanding on why Free Will limits the ability of the Machines to cap people's powers. There are many ways the machine could limit someone's ability. For example, Neo can move fast. So one way would be to check how fast someone is moving and if their speed would exceed a certain amount, set their speed to the max.

But this is a somewhat ""artificial"" limitation. It's like having a governor on a car. You press the gas pedal all the way to the floor, zoom up to 60 mph, and the car suddenly stops going faster. These ""artificial"" limitations would eventually be perceived through trial and error, revealing the illusion of the Matrix and defeating its purpose *as* an illusion.

Instead, machines can only limit people the way the real-world does, through the basic rules of physics, which then govern the rules of chemistry, biology, and ultimately the physical and mental limitations of your ""body."" But controlling this with a simple, deterministic, equation prevents Free Will and, thus, failure.

So the fundamental equations that govern the Matrix must be non-deterministic. They must allow for choice and, therefore, cannot prevent people from accessing abilities beyond what the Matrix might want.",1

It's a cost analysis kinda of thing. For some things, like nonverbal magic, educators decided the benefits outweigh the extra effort in teaching this skill. For others like wandless magic, they decided it's not worth it.

3. More complex magic still needs wands anyway—the students at Uagadou still use them for some spells.

1. Elves probably don't spend all their lives training, and in all honesty, Elves do not have the best record of staying alive in battle despite training all those years.  
2. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are royalty or close to royalty, with enormous amounts of combat experience and probably even higher-than-average training.  Aragorn, for example, pretty much went to every realm of Man, spent much of that time leading armies and fighting enemies under a different name.  Gimli's got a pretty martial tradition as a Dwarf from Erebor, and before that the Iron Hills.  Legolas is Thranduil's son, so I'd expect pretty good training.
3. You'd expect the commander and commander's guard to be protected.  Theoden, for example, would definitely not come out until it was desperate (as was the case), but Aragorn seemed to be in command of the Elves, and it's probably safe to assume that Gimli and Legolas would be unofficially his guards.  In a lot of ancient and medieval battles, a commander's personal guard can serve as an elite unit, and would be deployed at the crux of a fight.

1494,"The actual word for word prophecy was:

*""A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored.""*

It's origins are simply an ancient Jedi mystic. It's not really clear who said it or how they came to claim it. Further, somehow from this 1 sentence it was also ascertained that the Chosen One would destroy the Sith. I think the Jedi inferred this because it's what they think will lead to balance.

Anakin Skywalker *is* the Chosen One, and he *did* fulfill the prophecy, but the Force works in strange ways, and predictions about the future made through visions from the Force are... not unreliable, but they're sort of like Genie wishes. They often don't pan out how you'd expect. Ultimate balance in the Force *was* restored, and the Sith destroyed, but that doesn't mean that the dark side is destroyed, or that there will be no more conflicts between the dark and the light. What did happen though is this: The dark side was no longer disproportionately in control of the Galaxy. The light side was no longer obstructed or clouded by the dark side. The now misshapen and bloated Jedi order was swept away.

Essentially, what the Jedi thought would happen is the Chosen One would rise through the ranks, destroy the Sith, and lead the Jedi into an era of prosperity and clear purpose once more. What ended up happening though, is that the Force was cleansed by fire. What was there could not be fixed. The Sith had too deep roots, too many back up plans, to be simply overthrown. The Jedi were too misguided, too self-righteous to ever get back on their original path.

There is an upper limit to how powerful he can make a suit, though.

That suit is already able to tank shots from the Power Stone, after all.

It's possible he can do this. Jane Foster recognized some Asgardian ""magic"" as quantum tomfoolery, and Thor himself said that to his people, the line between science and magic is more semantics than anything. And the Asgardians themselves must have, at one point or another, figured out how otherwise normal people could tap into what we call mystical energies.

So Tony might be able to construct a suit that calls upon the same powers as Stormbreaker, or channels energies in the same manner as Strange.

Besides that, she doesn't necessarily know if she can use the Gauntlet.  Assuming the team shared what happened to Thanos after he used it in *Infinity War*, (and there's no reason they wouldn't), she knows that the Gauntlet nearly killed Thanos when he first used it, and the second use left him weak enough to be easily taken down by the Avengers.

1545,"Their relationship has often been strained, particularly when Reed becomes focused on his research and ignores her. In the 616 universe, they have been separated once or twice, but always came back together as Reed realized Sue brought balance to his life.

In the Ultimate Universe, Reed was far more cruel than his 616 counterpart. He had no problem killing his enemies, and consciously decided morality was a restriction in his scientific endeavours, thus becoming the evil Maker after Secret Wars.

There is actually a canon reason why so man Reed Richard counterparts are indifferent at best or cruel at worst. Reed Richards-616'a father was Nathaniel Richards, who later would travel to Earth-6311 and father a child there, and that child would be the ancestor of Kang the Conqueror. At one point Kang was eliminating many dimensional counterparts of himself from ever existing, and abducted hundreds or even thousands of Nathaniel Richards, and had them do battle to the death until their were only two left, ""evil"" Nathaniel and Nathaniel-616. Nathaniel-616 contacted his son Reed, who was in college, as well as Ben Grimm and Victor von Doom, and they worked together to defeat evil Nathaniel. As a result, only one Nathaniel remained, the strongest survivor who eventually become the ancestor of Kang, and there would be no competing Kangs to descend from alternate Nathaniels. 

Unfortunately this had the side effect that almost every version of Reed was orphaned while a child, and did not have the love and guidance of his father growing up. Because of this, most dimensional versions of Reed tend to be more scientific minded but indifferent to the events of the world, not necessarily evil but not as caring to the state of the universe. Most of the members of the Council of Reeds are like this. Another effect is that most Reeds are not able to form the loving bonds of family and friendship that Reed-616 can, thus never marrying or having a family, and also never fathering Franklin or Valeria.

They won in the end because the Ellimist stacked the deck like the Drode said.  They had Visser One's host's son, and that played a part in the power struggles between Visser One and Visser Three.  They have someone who is empathic and intuitive enough to start rebellions in the ranks of the Yeerks and the Taxxons, without even realizing she is doing it.  Elfangor was put on Earth for years and allowed to father a human son, to give him incentive to even thought of giving humans morphing powers in the first place.  Of all the Andalites they could have ran into, they had Elfangor's younger brother, the only one who wouldn't have just killed them all when he found out what they were, because he trusted his brother's decision.

1547,"The easiest way would be to find a child or infant who had died but was born roughly the same time as you want to have been ""born"", they will already have a SSN and birth certificate. This is a common way people commit identity theft, but I'll be honest I'm not sure if a death certificate would become a problem, you would probably be able to argue that ""you"" are obviously alive and get the certificate expunged but that might draw attention you don't want.

Another way would be to try and claim refugee status, if you're accepted a new identity will be created for you by the accepting country, and from there you can get a passport to a third country and be on your way.

Maybe if you thought ahead you could find a newborn, bring him or her to the county register to claim a home birth, and register a new identity for yourself to use in another 30ish years, then hopefully return the infant.

Other options I can think of might involve bribery of certain individuals, but that's more dangerous for obvious reasons. There's people alive now whose parents sucked and never registered anything about them, so they're alive but have no proof, but realistically once you can get even one document that says you're you and can work from that.

I would fix that by establishing a postal service. Currently, the only messages in Westeros travel either by raven or by private courier; by establishing a mail service, we could benefit both the lords and the smallfolk by freeing up horses and riders from courier duties.

The first confrontation gives us Spidey on top form, bouncing off the walls and joking at the Joker.  

Who does not. take. it. well. at. all.  

Things get mighty dark mighty quick, because now Joker wants to wipe the smile off Spider-Man's face.  Given that Spidey is well connected to assorted people, that's how Joker tries to get to him: through his friends.  

Spidey's friends are pretty tough, so it's not as easy as it first appears but The Joker is nothing if not persistent.  He goes all in on Web-head, making him undergo one sadistic choice after another after another.  Peter Parker is stretched to his limits, and beyond them, but he won't give in.  So the Joker keeps pushing and eventually does something very, very bad to someone Peter cares about very deeply.  

That's when Spidey's demeanour changes.  The jokes disappear, which causes the Joker to think he's won.  But that's when Spider-Man tears his way through The Joker's minions and allies like they don't exist.  No one can put a hand on him, and The Joker realises belatedly that pushing this hero too far may have been a mistake.  

He runs, but Spider-Man hunts him down.  Wordlessly, in fact in total silence, Spider-Man relentlessly pursues the villain until The Joker actually experiences real fear for the first time in a very long time.  

The Joker regains consciousness after the beating of a lifetime.  He's trussed in webbing, suspended in a huge web, awaiting arrest.  He giggles.  Slowly, Spidey lowers himself - upside down, of course - until he's eye to eye with The Joker.  Joker delivers a little ""I broke you"" speech.

1583,"Yes - while Gandalf remained similar in personality and such, Gandalf the White was sent back significantly stronger in order to complete his task.

The thing we always have to remember is that magic and power in Middle-Earth are subtle things - it's not like Gandalf the White can summon bigger fireballs or anything, that's not generally how power manifests.  But the significant thing is that he was sent back as the *White* Wizard - taking the place of Saruman, who failed in his mission.  So while Gandalf the *Grey* was a bit quieter, a bit less self-confident (as humble as a wizard can be at least), Gandalf the *White* was a leader - he spoke with command, he was more willing and ready to impose his will onto others, and he had the confidence and power to lead, rather than just to advise.  He took on some of the aspects that were given originally to Saruman alone.

One of Saruman's greatest powers was his voice, and the power of command that he was able to place into it.  And we see several times that Gandalf the White has a similar power - able to heal and inspire Theoden, and able to stand against Saruman, ignore his commands, and speak words of power to break his staff, and able to command and hold off the Witch-King momentarily, even though it was the Witch-King's most powerful hour, where he was empowered by Sauron.  Gandalf the White rarely shows his power through more dramatic actions, but he is able to save Faramir twice and stand up to the Witch-King, which Gandalf the Grey either couldn't do or wouldn't do.

Gandalf the Grey, though able to lead the Fellowship, was largely an advisor - he was there to inspire the greatest of Elves and Men to great deeds, while keeping out of the forefront of the war unless absolutely necessary.  But Gandalf the White, while still possessing that power of inspiration, was made a *leader* as well, along with all of the magical benefits needed to do that effectively.  Instead of being a servant of the Powers in Middle-Earth, he became their prime emissary, and was empowered to do just about anything necessary to win the way.",1

1592,"Humanity's advancement isn't linear, it's exponential, with spurts and spikes triggering after some notable invention or discovery. Looking at broad strokes of human technological periods we have:

* Stone Age (lasted 3 million years)
* Metalworking Ages (around 5 thousand years)
* Pre-industrial ages (around 2 thousand years)
* Industrial/Pre-atomic (around 1 hundred years)
* Atomic/Pre-Information (a few decades)

The advancements in each of those ages is equal or or greater than each of the ones that came before it. So it wouldn't make sense to, say, compare the past 10 years of the current era and wonder why they didn't have equivalent advancements in any 10 year period of the Bronze age for example. Advancement begets advancement.

LOTR is Metalworking/Pre-industrial which, in our own history, lasted 6 to 7 thousand years, depending on location. Perhaps not coincidentally, the lengths of the Second and Third Ages combined is 6,460 years.

I start at the Second Age because the First Age is mostly contained within Beleriand which was destroyed and the survivors are either Elves (who begin to wane and separate themselves from Men) or Numenoreans (who are are also distanced from other Men and explicitly more advanced).

So it isn't surprising that, by the end of the Third Age we see the beginnings of Industry after the same duration when we began to see the beginnings of Industry in our own world.

Now, if we go with the explanation that the history of Middle Earth is our own history, and we are currently in the Sixth, Seventh (or even Eight) Ages, then we can only really surmise some sort of catastrophe or period of stagnation due to the departure of magical creatures and beings from the realm.",1

The McGonagall family are also strongly Scottish, they hail from Caithness. The Quintin family are Scottish and they produce the Wizarding Scotch known as Quintin Black...

The Ravenclaws were also Scottish as evident that the Sorting Hat described her beauty as ""fair Ravenclaw, from glen,"" glen being a word for a valley in Scotland. There' also Modesty Rabnott and her sister Prudence as an implied example; Modesty was famously appalled by the treatment of the magical bird known as the golden snidget which was released during a Quidditch match so she snatched it out of the air and fled to release it elsewhere; she lost her house after being fined so went to staywith her sister in Aberdeen.

Tyere is a national Scottish Quidditch team, but they aren't known to be very good compared to other national teams. There' also the team known as the Banchory Bangers who were both known for their poor skill and excessive post-match parties, but who were also permanently banned from play and dissolved in 1814 after they allowed the bludgers they wrre using to fly off into the night and into Muggle residential areas and for trying to capture a Hebridian Black dragon to use as their mascot, enraging it enough that it flew into a Muggle town.

1608,"The Red Skull possessed an Earth-written version of *The Book Of Yggdrasil*, which he took from the same church that had been housing the Tesseract [Marvel Studios Visual Dictionary]. In Thor: The Dark World, Odin has an Asgardian version of the same tome, which he uses to reveal to Thor and Jane the history of the universe. He specifically mentions relics that predate the cosmos, and speaks of the reign of the Dark Elves before the big bang. This was just a few pages, so the entire book is likely to have contained at least some information on the Infinity Stones.

Red Skull almost certainly studied the pages of this tome, so he definitely knew a whole lot more about the universe than most would assume. It's very possible that the Infinity Stones didn't conspire to send Red Skull to Vormir, but that he accidentally sent himself because he was thirsty for power but inexperienced in weilding the Space Stone.",1
1609,"Men and elves were both stronger at the time of the Last Alliance. The elves were certainly in their autumn compared to past Ages but were more numerous and powerful than at the end of the Third Age, which is really their last hurrah. 

While Men had also declined from their height in the golden age of Numenor, they were still led by full-blooded Numenoreans, bolstered by prosperous and populous colonies that were also either Numenorean or recent descendents. While Gondor remembers those glory days, they're really just keeping the lights on and sweeping the floors.

Even with both of those, it still took a ~~year~~years-long seige to finally draw Sauron out of Barad-Dur. After his fall, his servants spent millenia weakening the Free Peoples. Moria and Erebor both fell, the elves of Mirkwood were isolated and harassed. Both Arnor and Gondor were wracked with internal and external enemies; the Northern Kingdom fell/dissolved entirely into roving bands of Rangers, while Gondor as mentioned is a shadow of itself.

On top of everything else, almost all the former alliances have broken. The Rohirrim regard the Lady of the Wood as a dangerous and vaguely hostile sorceress. Dwarves were always a bit isolationist but are now largely traveling craftsmen, never staying in any one place for long. What few elvish strongholds remain largely keep to themselves too. But even if they could present a unified front, at the end of the Third Age the Free Peoples couldn't put up a fraction of the power they did in the Last Alliance.",1

As for Mr Weasley ignorance, his problem is that while hes tolerant he also treats their stuff like a hobby. Remember he wrote a Law to give himself a loophole to tinker and figure out how cars work/enchant them for fun instead of just finding a way to interview an actual mechanic.

You would be given a tour of the country, including ""wealthy"" areas that house the King's advisors and administrators, and the ""poorer"" areas where the farmers, herders, and artisans live. These people would appear to live in conditions not dissimilar to the tribes people of neighboring countries and their poverty is apparent, though they do not appear to be hungry or particularly discontent with their conditions. Your visit will be concluded with a dinner with the King, who will primarily discuss Wakanda's textile exports. Questions about Vibranium will not be fully answered, and no Vibranium mines will be shown on your visit. You will walk away with the implication that Wakanda does not have very much Vibranium at all, which is undoubtedly why they are so protective of it.

To the visiting dignitary, Wakanda presents a strange contradiction. Your visit will be a completely controlled tour, similar to that of North Korea, you will be shown poor villages where people live in impoverished conditions. Nevertheless, everyone seems content, even happy, and even the poorest person you see looks to be fed and content. You feel as if the country must be performing a big show for you, similar to what North Korea is known to do, but satellites and spy planes show no sign of labor or internment camps, nor villages you aren't allowed to visit. Where would they be putting the hungry or discontented?

You leave the country with little of your questions answered, but nevertheless thinking that the country is more-or-less harmless. Wakanda poses no threat to your nation, no threat to its neighbors, and no threat to its people. Furthermore, Wakanda has little to offer you, they may not be the poorest country in Africa, but they have a small population and little material wealth to speak of. The little Vibranium they have must have already been used up, or stolen by Klaue, or else you or the satellites would have seen the mines.

There was a tournament match going on between Krillin and some stranger who coincidentally looks kinda like his teacher. There was a flash and suddenly they were in different places and Krillin was on the ground. The audience and announcer were left staring, slack-jawed. The announcer asked the fighters what had just happened in that instant.

When they met him, he had been floating in space for an indeterminate amount of time without suffering harm. His response to this ordeal was to ask for a cup of soup and a space shuttle so he could go grab a weapon powerful enough to kill Thanos. Assuming they believed that he was actually capable of that (and Rocket at least seemed to), that alone puts Thor near to top level of anyone they've ever faced. Rocket has also seen Thor unleash hell with Stormbreaker, so Rocket knows that Thor is at least an army killer. 

I don't think he actually saw Thor and Stormbreaker overpower the Infinity Gauntlet, though, which would raise Thor from ""very impressive"" to ""pants-shittingly impressive."" And Peter and the others weren't un-snapped until after Steve, Tony, and Thor did most of their fighting against Thanos is *Endgame*. So for most of the guardians, Thor's biggest feats were off-screen.

Also, Thor is the kind of guy people underestimate. He doesn't take many things seriously, and it's easy to think of him a joke, not a warrior-king.

1644,"Well the examples you listed here have very different reasons for using melee weapons so I try to explain them below in detail:


**Dune:**

While projectile weapons, such as Lasguns, exist personal shields make them useless in combat. Melee weapons are only used because they allow for movement slow enough to not be effected by the shields.

**Asgard:**


Asgardians are not just advanced aliens, but also Gods. Science and Magic are the same thing to them and since they follow a warrior's code of honor they feel that they need be directly involved in battle and don't want to hide behind guns and the like.

**Wakanda:**

Not only do they also follow a very traditional warrior's code, their weapons are also way more advanced than they look. What you see as a spear is way more powerful than a conventional firearm and their shields function similarly to a person's shield generator. That together with the fact that Wakanda was never involved in large scale wars meant that they never developed guns in the first place.",1
1645,"In Kart, Mario and others use Super Mushrooms and don't grow a stage larger.  This implies that they're already in their full size, like what happens when you grab a second Super Mushroom while already ""Super"" in other games: you either bank it or waste it, but you don't grow extra Super.

I think as ""Super Mario"" he is often Super by default; a Super Mushroom will return Mario to his regular (Super) size, not make him larger than normal.  Little Mario seems to be his injured or distressed state.

Little Mario is half the height of Peach, while Super Mario is contemporary in size.  In his sports and kart showings, he's not waist-high to Peach as Little Mario is shown during SMB1.  He's not knee-high to Bowser.  And while Bowser has some variance in size (I believe due to how much power he's possessing or utilizing), it's clear that this is normal sized ""Super Mario"" alongside Bowser.

Also, while Little, his dimensions are far more minimized than we see in these games.

The New Super Mario series shows a good modern example of how Mushrooms affect his size.  If he was Little Mario, this would seem to be suggesting that Sports/Kart Mario are currently small and would become even larger when touching a Super Mushroom, but that would be from the effects of a Mega Mushroom instead, which we also see used (and follows the same Mushroom rules I've explained above) in the Kart games.",1
1647,"There are at least a dozen ways to solve this problem in common use in the galaxy.  You can find long arguments in the technical journals about what the most effective detection method is, and what situations favor a different method entirely.  Still, we can avoid that by addressing your question:  What does an \*Astromech Droid\* scan for?  


Astromechs are packed full of sensors, and with so many custom droid mods they could be scanning for almost anything.  A stock droid would definitely rely on the extremely sensitive electromagnetic sensor from CryonCorp that's been standard since the P-series.  This is critically important for an astromech's core responsibility of diagnosing and repairing high- and low-voltage ship systems, but it's also sensitive enough to detect the activity of a biological nervous system.  If it has brainwaves, it emits detectable radiation.  


So far nobody's managed to tune an Astromech to read thoughts, but I still try to think polite just in case.",1

Superspeed then. It's basically a death sentence without the required secondary powers of being resistant to the friction. Plus there's also reaction times to consider.

Like the tiger beetle, who can sprint super fast, but they black out for a few seconds every time.

Now, even if you could resist burning in the atmosphere and deal with reaction time, imagine everytime you get to that speed, you'd have to gradually slow down.

McGonagall did the same at one point, and was proficient enough with the charm to cast three at once.

Snape also used his Patronus to guide for Harry through the Forbidden Forest without revealing himself, which would be another niche use. You could also use it as a light source in dark places if *Lumos* wasn't good enough for you.

Since Death Eaters are apparently incapable of summoning Patronuses, you could also use it as a test to prove someone was or wasn't one, if you needed to do so. Same deal with proving someone's a werewolf or not, which is why Lupin tried to never cast his. However, since Patronuses are literally the most difficult defensive spell to cast, whoever you were trying to out would have some wiggle room.

He argued successfully that said crimes were carried out by an evil clone created by Cadmus. He was cleared of all charges, not least of all because he had just traded his soul for health and vitality, so he was no longer a withered husk of a man dying of Kryptonite poisoning and contained in a suit of power armor. He was a healthy, non-Kryptonite-wielding man.

The public saw him as a wealthy industrialist who knew first-hand the dangers of the superhero community. He had the public's sympathy for being supposedly kidnapped and tortured while watching a monster with his face attacking innocent people. And also he created energy sources that completely removed America's dependency on fossil fuels, promising even more technological wonders if he had the backing of the US Government.",1
1672,"The paintings always confused me a bit. They don't seem to contain fully fledged worlds. More like set pieces that connect to each other. We see figures from paintings go into other paintings all the time. 

To me, the confusing part is the nature of the characters in the paintings. Many of them seem fully conscious, self aware, and even intelligent. Dumbledore's portrait gives advice to Snape just like when he was Alice. Can anyone have this type of painting made of themselves? It seems like a perfect way to preserve yourself after death.",1
1673,"I would say that you become a version of the woman who *appears to be* pregnant, with all of the discomfort, needs, and shape of such a state.

The kid is a separate entity, so you don't duplicate the kid, but the mom is, shall we say, *in quite a state*, and you get all of the annoyances of that state.",1

Hell, you could probably get away with Imperiusing a few of them if you really want to - in the unlikely event of you getting caught, just claim they were coming at you with some of those mechanical wands the Muggles use, and you felt threatened.

I'd say you can lie, cheat, steal, obliviate, find some clever way to cheat at high-stakes poker, use a Time Turner to give yourself the winners of a horse race or other sporting event (note: Do not get caught in possession of a Time Turner. They will put you in a box, and then put that box in a box, and then stick that box up a Dementor's butt).

One thing you **don't** want to do, though, is sell them illusory or transfigured goods to turn a profit. That's technically placing magical artefacts in Muggle hands, and that's one of the few intersections between Them and Us that the Ministry does care about.

1680,"Yes, absolutely.  

We have proof of that with 2014-Gamora surviving Tony's snap despite being a lieutenant in Thanos' army up until shortly after the battle began, and just before the army for the Avengers showed up.  Her decision to join forces with 2023-Nebula and save Hawkeye then fight against the Chitauri was enough for her to be excluded from Tony's snap.

Tony's thought as he snapped was most likely something along the lines of ""kill Thanos and his forces"".  The moment you stop working for Thanos, you're excluded from that.  The Mind Stone and the Soul Stone are able to determine that.",1
1681,"It's hard to say that anyone is the best in the world at *anything* bar none, but it's clear that John Wick's talent is legendary. 

I think the best example of this is in the first movie, when Viggo asks Aureilo why he struck his son. Viggo is a Russian crime lord, and striking his son is the kind of insult that gets people killed. Aureilo replies: ""Because he stole John Wick's car and killed his dog.""

And Viggo simply responds, ""Oh.""

That sentence changed everything. Viggo, the kind of guy who pays men to kill men, the kind of man who responds to an insult with death, knew that crossing John Wick was the absolute last thing you would ever, ever, *ever* want to do.

But, Wick isn't *so* good that people aren't willing to face him. There are plenty of random idiots who want to take their shot at $14 million, sure, but there are also a lot of trained professionals who think Wick can be taken down. People like Cassian, a seasoned professional, believe that Wick is mortal.

This might just be because Wick retired. Maybe they think he got slow. Maybe they think he lost his edge. But lots of people believed that they would be the one to take Wick down. He's a legend, absolutely, but he's not *so* good that people believe he's unbeatable.",1

1685,"Lets look at a fairly straightforward example: reflecting a blaster bolt in the middle of a firefight.  Several things could cause a Jedi to miss a bolt and die:

* Distraction: too much noise and chaos means the Jedi isn't focused on the Force, and misses the hint it's trying to send
* Inexperience: Two blaster bolts are coming at the Jedi, and they successfully 'see' both; but their body hasn't practiced the move they need to make to block those two bolts.  Without the muscle memory, they don't respond quick enough and get hit
* Clouded Force: a dark-side user on the other side has added a 'haze' in the force, meaning the Jedi doesn't know the blaster bolt is even coming, and wouldn't know even if they were listening
* Acceptance: The force shows them that it's their time to die, and they follow the force",1

A number of Batmen effectively manage to kill their universes in the ""Dark Multiverse"" scenario, but they mostly had the advantage of being able to fire the first real shot, no serious warning, just ""surprise, bitch, here's your war"". Without that ambush element, he'd have a much harder time.

By contrast, there was the time where Joker got to the rest of the League, and it was them taking the first swing; he burned through a laundry list of countermeasures and still found himself on the wrong end of a venomed-up Superman. Being able to take the initiative in the scenario and put Batman on the back foot shifted the entire dynamic of the fight.",1
1688,"The Ancient One put all her chips on Strange. She'd been waiting for him for years - she was fully aware of him and his activities at least as early as the first *Avengers* - and everything she did, like making him sit outside for a few hours before offering to teach him, was designed to groom him as her replacement.

The Ancient One was also smart enough to know what she didn't know. She trusted her instincts that Strange would be ""the best of them,"" and if he decided that he needed the Eye, that was good enough for her. The rest of the Masters simply followed her lead.

Also, the Ancient One *did* carry the Eye when necessary; we see that when Professor Hulk visits her in *Endgame*. Being ready to use the Eye in the face of world-ending catastrophe is common practice, and Dormammu breaking into this reality certainly qualifies.",1
1689,"He spent a lot of time (like thousands of years) training in the bargain with Dormammu.Between deaths and rewinds he perfected all his techniques,spells and casts.He had to have immeasurable willpower to force an interdimensional entity to surrender to his request.

1690,"One important thing to remember is that the Northern Alliance was not trying to destroy the army of the Undead.  Killing all the wights on the field of battle would be counterproductive: it would weaken their own forces, and the Night King could continue to raise new wights to continue assaulting the Kingdoms of Men.

Instead, the Northern Alliance was trying to draw the Night King in and convince him to go after Bran/Three Eyed Raven.  The plan was to make the Night King overconfident and make him think he could make the final blow personally, right there during the Battle of Winterfell.

I think it still went worse than the Northern Alliance was hoping, and they did a couple things that were unnecessary to that overall plan (like throwing the Dolthraki away unnecessarily).  But in terms of looking like they were completely unprepared for the Night King they succeeded completely.

Also note that many (maybe almost all) of those major commanders survived the fight, and according to ep.4 still have enough troops to properly assault Kings Landing... and it seems like they might have known what they were doing.

However, even if she didn't restore the vessels, it's possible that Cap wasn't interested in continuity. We know that Cap was returning the Stones either to eliminate the changes in the timelines or to prevent those timelines from being doomed by losing their Infinity Stones. If the former was his goal, then, yes, this would create continuity issues that would have changed those timelines even further away from what we saw in the movie. But if his goal was the latter, then he really doesn't care about continuity. It doesn't matter if the stones are back in their proper vessels as long as they're simply returned to their own timelines somewhere.",1

When an environment is static, there is way less stress on these things. That's why roads in places that are warm all year round need way, way less maintenance than ones with winters and summers.

Alfred has a really dry sense of humor, it's likely the statement was more joke than factual. IIRC there are other times in the comics where he's been shown to turn in around sunrise and sleep in until around noon during less... *eventful* periods which makes me think the ""three hours of sleep a day"" thing is more a statement of what he's capable of rather than his regular day to day schedule",1

The only time in the film that Thor could go to Doctor Strange is right after the first encounter with Gorr.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

By comparison, from the Fellowship leaving Rivendell to the remaining company returning after the quest is only a little shy of ten months (December 25 3018-October 5 3019).

It is unclear why other portions of the suit were not similarly treated, though it may have to do with Sidious' seeming desire to use the armor to remind Vader of his new vulnerability.

Voldemort at that time was still trying to hide the fact that he has returned while he was still gathering his forces.  Showing up at the Ministry to remove it himself, if it was witnessed by any of the many employees there, or if he left any trace that could have been linked to him, then the world will know he had returned, as was what happened at the end of the book.  So that leaves Harry the only one who could do it.  

This is why Voldemort had to trick Harry into getting the prophecy off the shelf while sending his Death Eaters to fetch it from him.  Some of the Death Eaters are employees themselves so they have an alibi for being there.  As for the others, it can just be explained as the escaped convicts acting on their own, just as the public believed Sirius was in the third book.

Hawkeye is known to use high tier trick arrows (such as those potentially tipped with vibranium for deeper penetration, web or acid arrows, some kind of blinding effect arrows, etc), and could possibly penetrate the eyes if not caught. Additionally, it's a reflex to protect your viral areas (*especially the face, and even more so for the eyes which allow you to perceive threats*) rather than just to calmly no-sell deadly projectiles.

Like if someone swings a newspaper at your face from just behind you and you see it in your peripheral vision. That won't necessarily do much damage to you, but instinctively you're going to block and try to disarm the threat to protect yourself. Catching the arrows protects his face and vision comfortably, dissuades Clint from attempting that kind of shot again, and controls the AoE/impact of the arrows as he now holds them directly instead of letting them hit him or the surrounding areas (although he didn't consider the arrows blowing up, which regardless didn't do any damage).",1
1720,"It really does depend on who you were sending them to, and the content of them... 

Penguin, Black Mask, and the other gimmicky crime boss villains probably don't give a shit. They're sane enough to not go out of their way to hurt you unless they somehow feel insulted by the cards, and don't need the emotional validation enough to notice you stopping.

There's also a certain category of villains for whom sending these cards is a *terrible* idea, because it makes them aware you exist. Victor Zsasz, the Joker, Two-Face on a bad day, Scarecrow... These villains just enjoy fucking with people, and attempting to show kindness to them just makes you a target. 

A decent number might be kinda baffled. Ivy probably has no idea why you're sending them cards, but might be prompted to look further into your situation to figure out who you are (If you're a decent person, you *should* be fine. If you're in a shitty relationship or have some kind of abusive ex, you... Probably won't by the time Ivy is done). Riddler would likely think it's some kind of puzzle and overcomplicate it, unless you explicitly wrote the card as ""appreciation for his genius"", in which case he'll consider you a fan. 

Then there's a few who would genuinely really appreciate what you've written for them. Killer Croc, if he's free, has probably already come by your place looking to see if you're okay. Harley Quinn will likely appreciate them, in her own strange way, but how that goes depends on if she's free of Joker at this point.

Example: In Warhammer, larger daemons are more powerful, but are harder to summon and can't stick around as long without the intervention of powerful magic or abundant fuel(skulls for Khorne, warp stuff for Tzeentch, etc), and the big four can't come through at all - reality just can't support their existence.",1

His lifestyle choices seem to only effect his appearance, not his strength. It's unclear if intentional exercise would provide any noticeable difference in strength. It seems his strength is closely linked to his ability to harness his own internal power, which before Ragnarok we thought was an external source (Mjolnir).

Anyway, they let him use the real hammer for a couple years because Thor was AWOL for whatever reason, but get this- apparently, the Asgardian's standard operating procedure for when they find someone else capable of lifting the hammer is to *build them their own,* if they decide they wanna do the cape routine.

People capable of lifting the hammer are rare as shit, and there are a lot of superterrorist groups out there with a tendency to try and measure the marigolds. *Somebody* is gonna try and dissect you at some point to figure out how you pulled this off- Hydra, AIM, maybe even Good old Uncle Sam or (God Help You) The *fucking* Canadians. The world doesn't need a weapon X freak running around with weird knockoff Uru hammer powers. That cyborg-clone motherfucker Ragnarok was tough enough to deal with. 

Get in good with the heroes now, do a two or three year stint as thundercloud or lightningstrike or whatever the fuck, and when things start going to shit you'll have a couple dozen A and B-listers storming the castle on your behalf. You're gonna have some level of involvement with this stuff for the rest of your life- at a minimum, there'll be a flower delivery van across the street from your house at all times, and you'll get Christmas cards from the Baxter Building folks- so I'd also advise learning how to kill people with your bare hands.

It's got an aura, it's not going to be sneaking up on any prepared wizards. And it only takes one wizard with a patronus to drive off a whole army of dementors. It's also implied that if they *didn't* run away, or if you forced the issue, you might even be able to destroy them with a powerful enough patronus. Otherwise they'd probably already exist in numbers too great to control, since they can reproduce but aren't alive enough to 'die' by natural means. 

There's also no indication that dementors can make muggle thralls, or that they'd want to. They possess an intelligence, but they're basically just hunger. They'd rather eat the muggles (who can't even see them, let alone defend themselves from them) than use them.

For Wanda, most people probably don't know she's a reality warper.  Her specific power set was hard to track down and Magneto wasn't a close father to any of his children so he can't really claim credit unless it's as an absentee dad.

As for Legion, most people are unaware of his relationship to Xavier.  To Xavier, Legion is a dirty secret that has to be hidden so it doesn't mar his wise professorial image.  Also, of the 3, Xavier did the most damage by leaving his son, no question.  Unlike Wanda, who probably owes her relative (remember, relative only, Wanda herself has proven to be mentally unstable due to her powers) mental stability to her relationship with her brother.  Legion didn't have anyone to talk to about his powers or what was happening to him.

Franklin, out of all of them, has the best homelife.  Stable family environment where the parents are both aware of his powerset and are able to rationally deal with it.  Franklin himself from what I recall, knows that his powerset is a danger and has specifically locked it down so he can't easily access the full range of it.

The reasons for not relying on clones:

1. Clones are expensive, forced conscripts/willing recruits are cheap in comparison.
2. The clone army was raised to be secret (can't enlist, that would be obvious) no need for secrecy = easy recruiting.
3. Clones age twice as fast as normal, high turnover = bad.
4. The empire was notoriously xenophobic, don't want to trust your army product to a bunch of aliens that are not even officially allied with you.
5. The non kaminoan cloning technique (Spaarti) produced unstable clones that aged even faster than kaminoan clones (roughly 20 times faster than normal) so they were really only good for cannon fodder, though they only took a year to mature.
6. The Kaminoans rebelled, hard. So kaminoan cloning was seen as a liability, since if the kaminoans rebelled once, whats to stop them from putting an order 66 type implantation in future clones.",1

Ever since Vader was informed that the pilot who destroyed the Death Star was named Skywalker, he had become obsessed with finding Luke. For much of the war post-Yavin, Vader threw his entire being into finding what he thought was his last connection to Padme. Luke was living proof that he wasn't alone, and that many of Palpatine's words were outright lies. Anakin had been distancing himself from his Sith master for quite some time before Luke, but his son was the big push he needed to start making plans to take Sidious down. Vader just didn't realize that pursuing Luke was also his path toward redemption. 

By the time of the fight on Endor, Vader was struggling mightily with his dark side persona and the one he called ""the Jedi"", a self-imposed lockbox of all his memories and feelings as Anakin. After his failure to capture Luke on Bespin, since he had promised to capture Luke and make him ""a powerful ally"" of both Sith lords, Sidious punished and tortured Vader mercilessly. It's why he was so cowed and seemingly hopeless when Vader brought Luke to the second Death Star. 

Vader half-assed the fight in the Emperor's throne room partly because he was following his master's instructions to do a grand pantomime in the hope of turning Luke to the dark side. But the other part was exactly as OP asked, his waning grip on the dark side and the resurgence of Anakin Skywalker. When Luke started drifting into the dark side and beat Vader into submission, he genuinely won that fight, because Vader was stuck in such a deep crossroads of his old and new personas struggling mightily in his head.

1807,"The cracking jokes is a combat tactic in a very real way - it's not indicative of ""messing around"" or ""toying with"" with his opponents, it's a viable strategy for him.

1812,One of the recent Vader comics covered that somewhat.  Padme was absolutely disgusted with what anakin had become and what he'd done.  She completely rejected him and refused to soothe him in anyway.  Vader for his part refused to believe he'd seen something real and that it was a trick.  He was lost in his grief he couldn't be the person padme loved and couldn't bring himself to even admit he'd killed her.  Assuming he was successful she'd turn on him and either force him to kill her again or kill herself to deny him any satisfaction.  If sidious found out about it he'd most likely put her into a medical coma of sorts to keep Vader under his heel but wouldn't outright kill her or vader.,1
1813,"There was a battle around Erebor. Since the death of Smaug and the passing of its throne to Dain upon Thorin’s death in the Battle of Five Armies, Erebor had become pretty prosperous by trade through Lake-Town, and became the new centre of the Dwarven world.

At the same time as the Seige of Gondor - indeed, not two days from the Pellenor Fields - Rhunian legions allegiant to Sauron attacked Lake-Town and forced the men there to retreat into the mountain. When news of Sauron’s defeat reached the easterling offence a little over a week of siege later, the tide turned. On the same plain before the mountain gate where the Battle of Five Armies had been fought, lake-men and dwarves sallied out together to win the day, and the chronologically last battle of the War of the Ring.",1

The first time, I'm sure he was told ""this is not even close to ready yet"" but he saw Spidey and thought he might not get another opportunity. ""Shut up and turn it on."" On it goes, disaster occurs. Doc Ock musters up a weak ""oh no"" as she collects tons of useful data.

Second time, same thing as the first time for Kingpin. Consequences are things that happen to other people, not him. If he had the ability to comprehend consequences properly, he wouldn't be tearing up the multiverse to get his family back.

What is more interesting is Doc Ock turning it on a second time. Unlike Kingpin, she would have had the hard data about the machine. What's most likely is that she actually thought it could be done safely, even if that conclusion came from grossly overestimating her own abilities. Even when there were other skyscrapers and such coming out of the collider, she didn't seem particularly concerned. Her interest in the whole collider process is less clear overall, but she *definitely* had a vested interest.

1832,"In most continuities, the only things we know of Thomas Wayne are Bruce's childhood memories and other people's idealized stories of the man. We rarely see the actual person behind it. I think it's extremely likely that Bruce will only remember the happy moments he had with Thomas, and Gotham at large will push any shady dealings and bad attitude under the rug in order to preserve the Wayne name. 

From the Flashpoint universe, we know that pushing Thomas to the breaking point results in him dressing as a bat and shooting criminals. So there's always been a darkness inside of him as profound as his son's. 

And in Telltale's version of Gotham, Thomas Wayne was far from a saint, but Bruce didn't learn any of it until long after he grew up and was operating as Batman. It didn't change anything fundamental about Bruce as a person.",1

1834,"Depends on your idea of painful. In legends the sarlacc will physically bond and merge into it's prey. A meal will be kept alive and fed nutrients for possibly years as the sarlacc uses it's victims to process the raw materials it's ""roots"" pull in. Once the prey dies of old age the corpse is broken down and recycled through other living prey trapped in the stomachs. Over time the victims become the stomach lining and intestines of a sarlacc processing it's food in a symbiotic relationship of sorts. 

While most animals process thoughts and emotions the same as a sarlacc they're only vaguely aware of the true horror that's happening as their body becomes one with the sarlacc. The reason the pain and torture can last a thousand years is because the mind of victims are merged as well as the body. The mind of a victim is pulled into the sarlaccs and becomes a part of the creature. 

For a brief time the victim is aware of their body wasting away and being slowly fed to other victims, but they're unable to lose sensation or lose consciousness or ""die"". The sarlacc slowly feeds of their mind but this process takes a very long time. Usually long after the victims physical body is gone their mind is slowly being torn apart memory by memory as it gets lost in the sarlacc's neural pathways. It's a slow creeping madness as your body wastes away and you feel every nerve dying until all you feel is the beast's own hunger overwhelming every thought of your own. Eventually oblivion overtakes your mind but it could take years or centuries for some species to find release from the agony.  

Given a strong will and an appropriate amount a time a victim can momentarily take control of the beast's body and influence it. But it's rare to keep your mind when it's a few drops of rain compared to the ocean of memory and animal instincts that is the sarlacc's mind. It is possible for an old enough sarlacc fed enough sapients to begin approaching sapience itself. Only one was known to come this close and was killed before any tests could be confirmed however.",1
1835,Odin wanted to teach Thor a lesson not abandon him.  I have a feeling Odin didn't strip Thor of all his durability and if he received what would be lethal damage Odin would bifrost him back to Asgard and ask him what dying on Earth taught him.,1
1836,"There don't seem to be many opportunities to use it [strictly in the films at least].  The only times I can think of when it would have been applicable is when Qui-Gon was dying, but Obi-Wan was just a padawan at the time and may not have known how to use it.  Also when Anakin was dying at the end of RotJ, but again Luke probably didn't know how as he hadn't been taught.

As a side note, a lot of people seem to be freaking out about this brand new force power (as if we haven't seen new force powers in literally every movie so far), but I think we've seen it before.  In ANH, after Luke is clobbered by the Sand People, Obi-Wan places his hand on Luke's forehead, concentrates for a moment, then Luke regains consciousness a few moments later.  Even before RoS, I took that to be Obi-Wan healing Luke.",1

1842,"Step One: Sell a ship without a hyperdrive. As this is a garbage planet, you're going to be taken to the cleaners regarding the value you'd get for it.

Step Two: Buy a new ship. Remember how you're on a garbage planet? A new, working ship isn't going to be affordable with the meagre credits you earned selling that *nonfunctional* ship to rip-off artists. Now you're stranded, with no ship and not enough credits to justify what you've done.

Chartering passage is an option, but you put your life in the hands of whoever is flying you. If you're Random Smuggler #7, that's not a real concern because your life is worth virtually nothing to anyone. But the queen of a planet, who pissed off some of the richest people around? The bounties she could fetch would be obscene. Would *you* trust some random criminal with that?

And keep in mind, they decided to get a new hyperdrive at first when it seemed like the far and away simplest option.

But he wouldn’t be more powerful, and quite possibly would fail. The problem with the Jedi Order in the Prequels is that they had stagnated and become dogmatic in their own beliefs instead of following the Forces will. This is how the Sith were able to thrive under the Rule of Two, and culminate with Palpatine taking over. Operating in secrecy after the Thought Bomb, they hid themselves and adapted to the changing in the galaxy, gaining power and influence while strengthening themselves through the Master-Apprentice line. The Jedi believed them to be extinct and refused to accept when Qui-Gon said Darth Maul was a Sith Lord, claiming that they would have sensed the return of the Dark Side, showing arrogance at their own power. When Dooku told Obi-Wan that there was a Sith Lord in the Senate, the Council *refused to believe him and didn’t investigate at all*, instead deciding that being a Sith made Dooku a complete liar. It’s not until ROTS that they actually started to look for the Sith, and even then couldn’t find Palpatine until it was too late. Hell, they even decided not to train the strongest kid in the Force because he was “too old for training”. The *only reason* Anakin became a Jedi was because Obi-Wan insisted on honoring Qui-Gons last wish. As a result, Palpatine was able to manipulate Anakins fears and insecurity at the Jedi Order until Darth Vader was finally born. 

Yoda himself realizes this in Matthew Stover’s ROTS novelization: while fighting Palpatine in the Senate, Yoda sees how the Sith have adapted for the new battles and grown stronger in the Dark Side, while the Jedi only were ready to fight the last war. It’s why when Obi-Wan actually brings up your prompt, to train Luke as Anakin should have been from birth, Yoda tells him no. That the Force will bring Luke to them when he is ready to learn. 

And because of this, Luke is able to have attachments. He goes to Cloud City to rescue his friends despite his training not being finished, who were only still alive at that point because Vader knew Luke would come for them, which is what allowed them the chance to escape the Imperials. When he learns Vader is Anakin, Luke tries to bring him back to the Light, despite Yoda and Obi-Wan believing that Vader is irredeemable. It is becuase of this love, that Anakin is able to kill the Emperor and save Luke, fulfilling the prophecy. If Luke had been raised by Obi-Wan, then he wouldn’t have been able to hold onto those attachments and would have been killed by the Emperor on the Death Star, dooming the galaxy. So ultimately if Obi had trained Luke he would have been a better Jedi Knight, but not been able to save Vader and stop the Emperor.

A 22 year old will be focusing on starting a career, having already graduated college. They've likely lived on their own for a while, will be planning for the future.

Despite being a relatively small age-gap of only 4 years, these two people have entirely different priorities, and the 22 year old would hold a large power imbalance over the 18 year old, who is just starting their lives as an independent person.",1

Typically the moment you use the wrong pronouns you're talking to someone else, who, if they know, will correct you. No harm done.

I really don't understand why people have such a problem with this. 99% of time pronouns will be what you think they are. The rest of the time, in my personal experience at least, people are pretty good at dropping enough hints into a conversation for you to figure it out - just like single vs married, you don't just outright ask someone, you give them enough room in the conversation to tell you.

Jet fuel melted the steel beams. 

Jet fuel wasn't the sole cause of the beams failing. First off you have a jet crashing into a building at a relatively high velocity. This causes fractures in the steel throughout a good chunk of the building's substructure including the load bearing sections. As the fire rages the substructure begins to develop gaps that get bigger and also reduce the stability of the building. As the substructure fails the building is more and more reliant on the fractured load bearing sections of the buildings. Eventually the load becomes to much for the fractured load bearing sections and once that happens the building will pancake exactly like what we saw happen.",1

1994,"In America incomes are very high, and eating out is a very common form of luxury spending. It would be much cheaper to buy groceries and make food at home, but there are many people so accustomed to eating out that they'll say they ""can't cook."" There's no cultural stigma against cooking (in fact it's usually seen as an attractive trait), but people resent the idea that they would be forced to do it because of their financial circumstances.

There is some difference between regions in that there are more restaurants closeby in urban areas, and in rural areas you might not even be able to get food delivered. For most people though, whether urban or suburban, it's very common to drive to restaurants or get drive-through good, since car usage is so high.

> How expensive are groceries in the US, proportionally speaking? Once you factor in money, fuel, gas/electricity and the time it takes to buy and prepare food, do the dishes, etc., does it just not make financial sense to eat at home?

It's easily much cheaper to buy food at home. Grocery costs are much smaller parts of the household budget than they used to be, but it's often still people's biggest expense after housing, utilities, transportation. Some areas are known for food being very expensive compared to the rest of the country, especially Hawaii and Alaska.

> Where are the grannies? I'm a South American of East European descent, there's always some granny nearby trying to literally feed me to death, so what's the deal up there? Are you shipping them off to the Caribbean? Are all the food trucks owned by grannies?

Americans move around a lot and often far away from family, only visiting for holidays. Although this differs a bit by area and culture, it's also not that common for grandparents to live with the rest of the family. So while this stereotype certainly exists in the U.S., most people don't have a granny to cook for them.

> And last but not least: could it be that what I'm seeing is a correlation between overly online people and people who eat outside of the house?

They can put a simple attenuator in line with the headphone to cut the volume to a safe level and leave everything else about the volume controls the same. If they want to let you do both they often need two different different audio amps, one for the speaker and one for the headphone. You will find this in better audio equipment and the headphone will typically be marked as “monitor”. The intent is usually to allow someone at the device to listen to the audio while the speakers are connected remotely. For small devices like a hand held radio, there just isn’t much of a use case to enable both so why incur the cost of components to allow both.",1

In my area in the Midwest, that means mowing every 2-3 days in the spring, but much less when things dry out in the summer.

He felt that continuing to send a lot of raw materials and in other ways continuing to cooperate with Germany would buy him the time he needed to decide that matter later on, when the USSR was ready and able to consider such moves. It's also worth bearing in mind that he had very recently watched the Red Army get its ass handed to it by tiny Finland.

As water vapor gets cooler it condenses into water droplets that become rain. This lowers the humidity. Since the water temperatures are cooler more north, there is less evaporation from the ocean to replenish the storm keeping humidity down, plus the evaporate moisture it picks up is cooler and allows the storm to fade out.",1

When hoping to solve an emotional issue, it’s counter-productive to try to be “objective” and put things into perspective, especially if it comes across as a defensive response (which you admitted it was). It’s about recognising the _isolated_ impact of the specific issue the partner is bringing up and working to understand _that specific issue only_. I really recommend the book and look into other material on the parent-child dynamic in relationships. While in the whole context, this may feel like an exaggerated description, there are clearly times where this is what’s going on, whether you mean for it or not. The gender aspect is not to be ignore either, as it’s especially common for men to end up on the “child” end of the equation, which is hard on both of you. She may also be getting some exposure to the concept of “weaponised incompetence” which really doesn’t seem to be what you’re doing here, on purpose, not at all, BUT I can tell you that when my own wife was in your wife’s position, her distress did bring her to wonder whether I was perhaps being careless on purpose or careless by being thoughtless and inconsiderate, because I’d just expect her to pick up the slack. They don’t say that because they don’t love us or truly believe it, but it’s a natural thing for them to at least wonder about.

There’s a way out of this cycle, man, if you put the effort in to take apart the real elements leading to the issue, and materials meant for people with ADHD and their spouses could really help you here, in my experience.

I’m a big believer in reading up on systems used by people to solve problems, whether  I share a diagnosis with them or not :)

Edit: Realised this may not have been clear, but your wife may totally be aware of the help you give her with the driving (for which she may have her own unexpressed insecurities as you do? so maybe it was an extra pain point regardless), the packing up etc. She knows you’re competent and consistent in that respect, but she seems to have difficulty dealing with what to her are your “unexplained” struggles with completing other assorted tasks, like the hamster one. It can be an anxious thing onto itself, to wonder whether your partner can handle anything else but the standard tasks you know they can. I say this because if this interpretation is correct, I’m your counterpart and I find it very hard to competently complete “new” tasks with full awareness of what’s going on sometimes, especially if I need to measure up against my partner who’s co-doing the task with me. I’m slower and our approaches are different and this distresses her - she’s faster snd therefore ends up waiting on me and ultimately giving me “instructions” to do simple and quick (to her) things when I haven’t yet moved on to the next step when she’d expect me to have.

Bottom line is - when someone is particularly frustrated or anxious about their partner’s ability or willingness to help in a relationship in the way they hope for, it’s easy for them to be a little bit unfair in how they portray the total share of work. This is not because she can’t see the objectivity of the task sharing and mutual support, but it’s  because the things she worries about have more relative weight to her. Focusing on this has been key to my own improvement in my marriage.

Second edit: Mate, at the risk of sounding nosy, I looked at your profile a bit more and you should look into an ADHD diagnosis. Just some advice from someone who thinks she can recognise it - worst that can happen is you rule it out :)",1

Especially in a little four-cylinder car you can hear the engine and see the RPMs rev up just a bit when you turn on the A/C.  Yes: ultimately it uses a little more gas to use the A/C.

Your car should be able to idle with the A/C on.  And really… you shouldn’t be getting so low on gas that this matters.  Don’t let yourself get that low.  It’s not like a drastic difference.

One big clue here is that most astronomers and planetary scientists are of the opinion that life is all over the place.

2255,"Hey OP, I'm a non-binary trans person and while many of the responses answer parts of your question, it seems no one has addressed it as a whole, so I'm happy to break it down into parts for you addressing each part of your question:  


1. **Altering the body to match the mind (are there other conditions where we do this?)**  
Actually, yes! Body Integrity Disorder is one such mental disorder, in which the individual believes a body part ""does not belong to them"" or should be amputated. For decades we tried to treat BID with therapy and medication, but found that the individual's distress would only remit once the offending limb was removed. Therapy and pharmaceutical intervention were so ineffective that p*eople with BID would find other, non-medical ways to remove or amputate their limbs, often leading to complications, sepsis, and death*.  
If you interview people with BID post amputation they overwhelmingly report their quality of life has improved, *even though they are now disabled*\--and here's another kicker, there are often no other signs of mental illness. BID isn't associated with histrionic personality disorder, or some type of munchausen's.   
In brain scans of individuals with BID, you can see the center of the brain associated with that part of the body is not functioning properly. Short of developing some type of complex neurosurgery to fix it, this is the best option we have.  
*(Quick note here: there is a common myth that trans people have brain scans that align with their preferred gender--this myth was perpetuated in part to normalize the acceptance of trans people back in the 90's, but it's continued perpetuation is harmful not only because it is scientifically false, but because it invalidates the gender identities of non-binary trans people. there is actually no such ""test"", nor are there structural differences between a ""male"" and ""female"" brain--though hormones do have a noticable impact on biological function and can in some senses change the brain, you wouldn't be able to see this pre-HRT. more on this later)*  
**Despite some interesting face value similarities between Body Integrity Disorder and Gender Dysphoria, BID and its treatment is fundamentally different from something like gender dysphoria and gender reassignment surgery, which are only partially related to discordance with the body.**  
This is because **there are many types of dysphoria**\--***body dysphoria*** (relating to the body as a whole/gender presentation), ***bottom dysphoria*** (relating to genitals), and ***social dysphoria*** (the way people are perceived socially and culturally in terms of their gender) are some of the most common--though there are other types of dysphoria as well, such as voice dysphoria, height dysphoria, etc.  
It is also important to note here is that **not all trans people even have dysphoria-**\-many trans people simply have EUphoria from presenting or transitioning to the other gender. Additionally, non-binary trans people (who identify neither identify not as a man or a woman but as something between those states) may choose to do hormone replacement therapy to alter their body composition or voice, but *not t*heir secondary sex characteristics (breasts, genitals), OR they may get Gender Affirming Surgery (such as top surgery to remove the breasts) but opt not do HRT.  
**There is a HUGE range of types of trans and non-binary trans people, and within that range there are an endless amount of expressions and identities.**   
Some of us have social dysphoria but not body dysphoria. Some of us get surgery and HRT and others don't. Some of us change or names and pronouns but don't change anything else. Some of us do a mix of the above, caring selectively about some things but not others. I know some trans women, for example, who had profound social and body dysphoria but not bottom dysphoria, so they took estrogen and transitioned socially but did not take Testosterone blockers, and therefore retain full use of their penis.  

2. **Why do people get to choose their gender?**  
**We don't.**   
That's kind of the point, actually.We were born into the bodies we were born into, and if we're the lucky 99%, our bodies match the gender we are. If we are the unlucky 1% that is born trans, we have to negotiate with our bodies, hormones, and socially constructed societal roles to change what doesn't feel right in order to lead authentic lives.I don't know your gender, OP, but imagine if you woke up tomorrow in the gender of the opposite sex. How long do you think you'd survive before you lost your mind? Once the novelty wore off, you'd be left horrified, isolated, and dysphoric. Living this way is unsustainable for trans people, and we don't get to choose it. There isn't something wrong with our brain, like there is with other mental disorders--and the ONLY reason it is coded in the DMS as a ""disorder"" is so that therapy for gender dysphoria can be coded and billed through insurance. It is a common misconception that being in the DMS somehow validates that trans people are mentally ill. Know what else is in the DMS? GRIEF. This is so people suffering from the loss of a loved one can get insurance to cover their therapy.  

3. **""Why can't we align the mind with the body rather than the body with the mind?""**  
Because there is nothing broken with the mind. We have decades of neuroscience to substantiate this. Gender is, in large part, a social construct--*but this does not invalidate the REALNESS of that construct.* **We have a personal relationship with our bodies, just as we do with our minds, they are not separate entities.**   
If you went blind, or lost your ability to speak, you would feel like you were losing a part of yourself, not JUST your body, right? A huge part of our identity as humans relates directly to our bodies, how they are perceived, and how we perceive the world through them.  
It's really no different with trans people. There is a feeling of LOSS as well as a feeling of BURDEN, and **the need to attenuate the loss by ""adding"" what is missing** (breasts, a penis, longer hair) **and ""subtracting"" what is burdensome** (facial hair, a penis, beasts) **is really the only way to make people feel whole.** Some trans people require only a select few of these additions and subtractions, and some require all of them. Needing one, some, or all does not make people any more or less trans than someone else though, because being trans really just means we don't identify with the gender we were assigned at birth.   

4. **ON GENDER AFFIRMING CARE FOR CIS PEOPLE**  
I am actually a HUGE supporter of GAC for ALL people, not just trans people. You're a cis man who can't get hard and need to take Viagra? You should take it! You're a cis woman who feels like less of a woman bc you're flat chested and want breast implants? Get them!  
**Gender Affirming Care and HRT (hormone replacement therapy) is actually routinely practiced  for cisgendered people in the medical field--we just haven't politicized that as much (yet).**   
For example, menopausal women are routinely prescribed hormone replacement therapy in the form of birth control to level out their hormone levels as they drop or fluctuate due to menopause.   
Similarly, it is not uncommon for cisgendered men to receive extra testosterone due to low T levels, which can have debilitating health impacts.   
Gender affirming care is also crucial for intersex people, who may have phenotypically male or female presenting bodies but are hormonally misaligned, or you have conditions where a man was born with ovaries, or a woman was born without a uterus, and needs to be on medication to correct hormone imbalances. We don't talk about intersex people much, but they do exist and in higher numbers than you'd think. Some people even go their whole lives without knowing they're intersex at all, until they try to conceive, or have other medical complications later in life.  
**The reality is that EVERYONE--cisgender, transgender, intersex, and those with medical conditions all need access to quality health care, including gender specific medical interventions.**   
Of course, in an ideal world, we should all have access to what we need to feel happy, healthy, and whole. **The reason TRANS affirming care is prioritized over CIS gender affirming care is because without gender affirming care, trans people simply kill themselves.**  


I just want to say, OP, I really appreciate you coming here and asking this question with an open mind and an open heart. There is so much misinformation and propaganda out there and so many people who want to hurt and kill us for being different.   
**Trans people don't want special treatment,** ***we want the same things you do*****--to lead a life where we can wake up in the morning and feel comfortable in our bodies, where we can struggle and suffer and triumph and succeed, where we can find love and love ourselves.**

So your computer is basically just a whole bunch of really, really, really small gates that are opened/closed by electricity.  A gate can only be open or closed, it can't be part way open.  An open gate is represented by a ""0"" and a closed gate is represented by a ""1.""  This is ""binary"" and it's the deepest level of ""code"" in your computer, literally just strings like `10101100110101110100` that represent parts of your computer circuits having power or not having power.

Now obviously coding in binary would be pretty difficult, because humans can't look at `110100100` and know that it represents the number 420.  Back in the day you'd use [punchcards](https://i.imgur.com/XR6ET2o.png) to code computers, that you'd literally punch holes into, with the filled/not filled holes representing 1s or 0s.  Seeing as it's not 1950 anymore though we've got better ways of doing things, we've got other languages that we can use (C++, Plython, C#, Assembly etc), this is what your son is using.

If you wanted to print ""Hello World"" in python you'd code it as `print('Hello, world!')`, as a human being looking at that you can probably figure out what that does, your computer doesn't know what it means though.  So your computer translates it (like you would translate a language irl) into binary code and the excites the 1s and 0s (as in turning power to stuff on/off).

To answer your question more specifically when you're looking at a game there are two main elements you need to consider, the graphics (what you literally see on the screen) and the logic (the code behind it).  The grass in fortnight is an image that is saved onto your computer and the computer has to execute code in order to grab that image and know how to display it on a screen, but someone didn't code every part of that image by hand.  They just took a photo of some grass and the computer is being told to pull up that photo and display it on the ground in-game.

However the player does need to interact with that grass, as in their player character needs to be able to stand on top of it and walk around on it, and that logic needs to be coded into the game.",1

They'd be like ""now what?"" and collectively decide to keep advancing. A couple of Humvees would appear on the ridgeline, a couple of staff sergeants would get out and peer through binoculars at them, the crowd would get a bit tense and start to wonder if they're about to get shot, but the mob mentality would keep them advancing. Staff sergeant determines there's no threat here, puts his binoculars in away, gets back in the humvee and drives away. The confusion among the mob starts to increase, wondering why they're not met with the hostility and resistance they had so much anticipated.

&#x200B;

They'd march their way through long barren desert roads, past surveillance cameras, but no people.

&#x200B;

Eventually they'd reach a manned check-point and the hostility of the mob would start to increase again anticipating resistance from the military. Instead they'd be greeted with ""Oh we've been waiting for you guys, wondered when you'd show up... come on in"". The gate would open and they'd be allowed to freely walk through. The mob is now getting more and more confused and disoriented, they never expected to get this far. They're now in the mindset of a Jehova's Witness who's actually been invited into the house of the door they just knocked on. They're there to talk about Jesus but they don't know what to say beyond that point. They keep walking.

Finally they reach the gate. Fortified, blast-proof walls topped with razor wire and machine gun turrets extend out as far as the eye can see. A high ranking officer steps out, greets them warmly with a twinkle in his eye before saying ""You wanna see the aliens?"" The mob is now anxious, they never expected to get this far but fuck yeah they want to see the aliens, but first they have to go for a ""briefing"" and since there are so many of them they can only be accommodated in one of the huge aeroplane hangers. They drop their pickets and banners, and pile into a long line of personnel wagons which drive them across the base, getting a guided tour past the stealth bombers and other top secret projects, and pull up at the hanger. They all jump down from the wagons and gather inside the hanger. The doors slide shut behind them, the lights go down. The buzz and conversation among the mob slowly quietens down...

""When an adult is raped by a juvenile, the offense of statutory rape imposes criminal liability on the adult for the same intercourse by which the adult is a victim of rape. In this way, the offense of statutory rape criminalizes being raped; it criminalizes being the victim of rape. It criminalizes the failure to prevent or resist being raped by a juvenile. And neither defenses specific to statutory rape nor defenses of general application satisfactorily preclude liability.""

If you survive all of that, though, it will eventually dry into a lump perfectly molded into the shape of your anus with no way to get it out except incredibly invasive surgery. The more water you add to concrete, the longer it takes to dry, and the soupier it becomes, but it does still eventually dry (though technically concrete never actually stops the chemical reaction that adding water causes, even if it's only taking place on a molecular level).

Gender dysphoria however is a mental illness. The dysphoria is part of being transgender, and it's the part that comes with feeling in the wrong body. It can actually have severe effects on people, including self mutilation and suicide.

This is for full enucleation, but if you just remove the globe and replace it with an artificial eye, I would imagine leaving all the tear gland tissue in there will retain tear production. 

If I see an animal that has had an injury to the eye to cause it to shrivel up and become a big glob of scar tissue, the lid margins will remain as well as tear glands causing tears and mucus to accumulate in the socket around the shriveled up eye. Due to the fact that these are just gross and diminish the human-animal bond, anything like this is usually removed. You also have to consider that there may be some pain associated with a small scarred eye if enough cornea is present to feel pain of an eyelash rubbing it. 

If you just cut an eye out and left the hole without closing the wound, eventually scar tissue would slowly creep in from the edge and cover the wounded area. Tear production may occur depending on how much of the eyelid tissue is left.",1

If you have one eye or are blind; you will often see people sleep with their eyes open - REM sleep can still occur with open eyes. Sleep is a state that isn’t reliant on eyes closing or eyelids. 

The eyelids are protective mechanisms so they aren’t crucial to survival BUT people get a shit tonne of infections; foreign bodies and dry eyes without eyelids. You’ll find that anyone missing an eyelid will have dry painful eyes - eyelids are like a filter and without it it hurts to keep your eyes open.

2460,"First of all, children killing animals isn't necessarily a red flag by itself. It's not uncommon for a kid to stomp on a squirrel or something like that and then feel awful about it after. A lot of that is power tripping and a lot of that is curiosity, neither of which are by themselves indicative of psychopathy, because a young child doesnt know better. It becomes a red flag when the child is doing it out if cruelty/sadism - doing it just to cause pain. Or, if they're old enough to where they fully understand why they're doing it and why they shouldn't be doing it. In that case, they're probably doing it out of cruelty, which is a problem.

Second of all, a lot of it comes down to motivation. When a hunter tracks and kills a deer, you might call him an asshole, but he did it for the difficulty of it and the challenge, not because he really wanted to shoot a deer. If you just grab a deer and tie it up in front of a regular hunter they wouldn't gleefully jump at the opportunity to kill it, because that's not the point of hunting. If you kill animals just because you like killing them, then yeah, that's messed up. I think most people would agree to that. But there's always gonna be pride in accomplishing something difficult. That's why an animal carcass is referred to as a ""prize"" - it's something you earned. As for why it wouldn't apply to humans, the simple answer is that we just don't care as much about animals as we do humans. We take far less issue with killing them, and happily eat them every day. It's kinda like asking, if we like eating meat so much, who's to say we don't one day try to snack on some human flesh? It's just not how our brains are wired. Some people have messed up wiring, and that's why a child (or adult) killing an animal out of pure cruelty is a red flag. It's indicative of that damaged wiring.

When sperm travels through a female dog's uterus, chemicals including magnesium break down that coating. If the coating remains intact, the sperm's DNA can't fertilize the egg.""

We used to have gas ovens, which made it easy for people to kill themselves by turning the ovens on, sticking their heads inside, and killing themselves by inhaling the gas. When the ovens were changed to make them safer, the suicide rate dropped dramatically. This was used to prove the theory that the suicidal feeling was temporary and that if people found it harder to kill themselves, they wouldn’t do it. 

For people who are suicidal, we urge them to find someone to help them through this temporary period. However, having suffered through depression most of my life, I know how crippling and painful it is and I know that not all depression responds to treatment. 

I’m one of the lucky ones whose depression is able to be mostly controlled with medication and therapy, but I have been through hell and back.

There were approximately [37.9 million people across the globe with HIV/AIDS in 2018.](https://www.who.int/hiv/data/en/)

It's also worth mentioning that [HIV Life Expectancy in U.S. Now Matches General Population—With Some Big “Buts.”](https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-life-expectancy-in-u-s-matches-general-population-with-some-differences)

To answer your question specifically, more nuance is required.  While HIV is a virus that may cause an infection, AIDS (which is short for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is a condition. Contracting HIV can lead to the development of AIDS.  AIDS, or stage 3 HIV, develops when HIV has caused serious damage to the immune system.  As such, every person with AIDS has HIV, but not every person with HIV has AIDS.  Semantically, AIDS is the disease, and HIV is the virus that causes it.

If all humans with HIV were killed, the virus could theoretically still be passed from non-human primates to humans. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is a species of retrovirus that cause persistent infections in at least 45 species of African non-human primates. SIVsmm in sooty mangabeys and SIVcpz in chimpanzees, are believed to have crossed the species barrier into humans, resulting in HIV-2 and HIV-1 respectively, the two human immunodeficiency viruses.

Furthermore, there are undoubtedly tens of thousands of HIV samples in laboratories around the world.  Even if every human infected with HIV were killed, the virus could potentially propagate again if one of the samples were used to unknowingly or deliberately infect someone.

Lastly, people with HIV that take antiretroviral treatment (ART) may have an undetectable HIV viral load.  An undetectable viral load is where ART has reduced someone's HIV to such small quantities that it can no longer be detected by standard blood tests.  Consequently, it would be extremely difficult to identify a HIV positive person that uses ART, which would make identifying and killing them rather challenging.",1

2558,It may not be in Mein Kampf but Hitler did admit to getting drunk as a teenager and using his report card for toilet paper. That was the only time in his life he ever got drunk.,1
2559,"I have experienced the smells of hundreds of bodies, but it's difficult to know what their habits were in life as I only see them when they've been received into the mortuary. However, I can comment on things I've picked up on and hope they answer your question at least partially. Smells are very difficult to describe but I'll do my best!

If someone dies with high levels of alcohol in their system, i.e. they were very drunk when they died, you can smell this inside the body cavity. It's hard to describe, but kind of like fermenting fruit, it's a boozy tinge to the smell of meat; you can smell it straight away when you're removing the bowels.

(Now apologies if this is obvious!) if someone has eaten a huge meal just before they died, their stomach will be extremely full and this stomach contents has a revolting smell. This is because it is vomit, really, so I guess maybe if someone was a very big eater, you can often pick this up from meaty smells when you're removing the stomach as often when you are holding the stomach, gas can escape and this results in a meaty puff of air.

If someone is quite fat, then their body will have a higher water content and they are more likely to undergo a wet decomposition process. I cannot even begin to describe the smell of this, it is beyond words. The closest I could say is like really, really bad bins, mixed with rotting chicken, but mix it with faeces and multiply it by 10. It's a horrible smell that sticks to you all day in your hair, in your nostrils, underneath your fingernails (somehow? We wear gloves and yet you can smell it for hours after on your hands!)

On the other hand, a slim body is likely to mummify, especially in dry and hot conditions. A mummified body smells extremely similarly to fish sauce and dog chews (the ones that are like beef jerky).

Another point on smells is that bad diets will often manifest in the faeces. I remember a case where the deceased ""consumed only cigarettes and Jaffa cakes"" the Coroner's report said. I have never before seen such constipation and impacted faeces. To attempt to explain, the rectum is supposed to be around 1.5 - 2 inches in width. This person's rectum was so full of faeces that couldn't pass that it was around the size of a large grapefruit. And I am not exaggerating.

(I know you were asking about lifestyle and habits, but another point on the smells may interest you: if someone is just beginning to decompose, their abdomen will swell due to a gas buildup. When you cut the skin, the pressure means that a jet of this gas will escape with a hiss, and this smells extremely like rotten eggs.)

EDIT: thank you very much for the award! It says healthcare hero and that's honestly made my day. We do this job for the deceased and their families, so even to have a Reddit award is a lovely bit of acknowledgement. Thank you! 

Again, thank you very much for the awards, this is very kind and unexpected; I'm touched! Glad you got so much pleasure from reading about the smells in a mortuary!",1

They would make fun of a student with autism for not wearing deodorant, they would make fun of each other for not being able to sit still/read out loud/handle fire drills, and there was constant, extreme bullying toward a student who had bowel incontinence issues. :( It was pretty similar to regular bullying, with the main differences being that they had extra ammunition compared to my other classes, and the cyberbullying wasn't quite as effective as in my other classes—fewer of the kids in that class had phones or social media, so most of them couldn't really be teased outside of school except behind their back.

Short version:
Money believed gender is learned not born into. David suffers a botched circumcision and Money convinced his parents to raise him as a girl. Money claimed it was a success but David never felt right as a girl and realized by about age 9 he was meant to be a boy. Money did some sick experiments on him and his twin brother. David eventually committed suicide. 

When I was in college we watched a documentary on the case as part of a class in documentary film. We studied it as a question of ethics in documentary. This was before David had killed himself(the only reason I know it was prior to his death is I graduated in 2001 and he killed himself in 2004). I don’t recall the name of the documentary off hand.

So first off, banks and private lenders don’t hand out $25M to just anyone. The borrower will typically put up some sort of collateral such as real estate, that is worth at least the amount borrowed, so upon the borrowers death, the lender would have some claim to that collateral in order to recoup the debt.

So yes, a borrower can just go crazy and throw the money around if that gives them joy, but they wouldn’t be getting away with anything, since they (or their estate after they die) would be out the same value of collateral anyway, once the lender realizes the debt is not going to be paid off as expected.",1

Never rat anyone out. Befriend the guards only to give you a better cell with more civilized inmates if your current ones are assholes.

Tips: Usually inmates with longer sentences tend to behave better than new inmates who feel like they have something to prove. They will be there for a year or so and that makes them cocky.

Hygiene is very important! No one will like you if you stink. 

People will be bored quickly there. Have a good sense of humour. But never at the expense of someone or their outside family.

Never judge. Everyone is a sinner out there. Accusing or criticizing will only bring you troubles.

Don't stare. Some people can kill you for a perceived nasty look.

If you have a smaller build which makes you easier to be picked on start going to the gym inside the prison.

Never respond to insults. It's better to laugh at yourself. That shows you are an easy-going guy and nothing they say affects you.

If you see a fight, even if some is dying, do not involve. You have no place in separating two pit bulls. The best you can do is yell for a guard, but even that is troublesome.

If someone wants to fight you reframe the fight. Chose an arm sparring or a slapping contest. You will be surprised to find out that people will be entertained enough to see that instead of a blood bath.

Now if a fight is unavoidable start learning Krav Maga or LINE before you go to prison.

I spent 3 months obsessed with suicide. I watched videos, read instructionals, spent a ton of time on r/sanctionedsuicide . I finally worked up the courage to finally do it.

2) I was very methodical. I had everything ready all my suicide notes my little note on my door saying don’t open call police. I just felt relief that everything would finally be over

3) I can’t remember much just some panic because It hurt and then that slowly faded as I started blacking out

4) something like 10 seconds because I hung my self and achieved a blood choke so I cut of circulation to my brain before I was able to feel the asphyxiation

5) I knew when I tied up my noose in the closet and tested it to make sure it wouldn’t break 

6) I never went into a coma I just passed out and went in and out of consciousness in the ambulance and hospital 

7) I remember the EMT trying to get me to respond to him. I just remember thinking “fuck” I was so mad in the hospital when I was fully conscious because I wanted to die and I screamed at my dad about if he really loved me he would have left me alone. Tried to hang myself again in the psych ward",1

2668,"This is a hard question... even for me. When my mom was in labor with me, they had to do a crash c section because my heart rate was dropping. I came out dying.  Within hours I was diagnosed with 5 congenital heart defects and congenital lung defects. I had my 1st open h eart surgery at roughly 10 hours old. 

My entire life has been controlled by my health issues. I've always been greatly affected by them. I also have other health issues that came later   Along with 2 strokes and a heart attack. With all this plus 18 surgeries... this all happened before turning 16. But for me, it's my normal. This is all I know. I've flatlined several times to be brought back to life... not counting the times during my 5 open heart surgeries. 


While I'm so very grateful to still be alive, dispite being told I would never see my 5th birthday, let alone my 27th this year... 
having the health issues I do... it's daily. It's not just the big surgeries. I take 8 pils a day. Most are 2 x a day. I'm on 6 inhalers and 2 meds for breathing treatments. While my health issues aren't all of who I am, it controls a huge portion of what it lets my body do. 


I can't work. I live with my mom. I'm still being forced to watch people my age go out into the world and live the life I wanted. 


Sitting at home watchin Netflix all day isn't a life. I feel like more than ever now I can't relate to those my age.

So again, while I'm glad to be alive... it's not a life I'd wish on anyone. 


I'm unable to have kids for several reasons. Mainly because of my heart and one working lung... if I found out I was pregnant and they had a birth defect.. I can't say what I'd do. It breaks my heart I won't ever have that, to even think about an abortion. Of knowing to let them live when I've lived through all the medical stuff I've been through.

Humans are built to recognize patterns, whether visually or audibly. The music or white noise such as a shower fluctuates, and your brain naturally tries to pick out a pattern, even when one isn't there. When it hears or sees something close to a recognized pattern, it will assign meaning to it and due to filling in the gaps our brains do, sometimes it will sound like a voice, or look like Jesus on your taco, or an elephant in the clouds.

2715,"Those 10% would kill an inordinate amount of people and forever alter the world in ways that would be spoken of in the future like we speak about things like Noah's ark now, only this would be real. The average person is not prepared for some one in full rage mode but still harboring average intelligence to come at them with a gun, axe, bat, knife, etc out of no where with the intent to kill. It's not like it would be 90% on one side of the field and 10% on the other. 

It would be a mother giving her husband a hug from behind and slitting his throat, followed by her children. Then knocking on the neighbors door and going full murder mode when they opened it. It would be a hospital nurse injecting lethal doses of medication into patient after patient until caught, and then going after those that caught her with a scalpel. It would be any average citizen or law enforcement personnel with a gun turning up in a populated area and opening fire in every city, everywhere, but repeated over and over. Some would defend themselves, and it would be nearly impossible to tell them apart from the maniacs at first glance.

Society would, at least for a good while, collapse. The carnage on the first night would be ungodly. Even if every blood lusted person only managed to kill 2 people on average, that would be over 1 billion dead and an additional 550 million lost to the madness. 2 on average is, by my guess, wildly optimistic. 

Once word started getting out, no one would be leaving the house for anything. *Maybe* hospital staff would still be working in locked down hospitals, but even if some ambulances stayed running there would be nowhere near enough. Police would move only in squads and would be putting people down left and right. Any form of military body remaining would be distributed across major population centers and, if someone intelligent was in charge, would also secure farmlands, trucks, and diesel supplies. But for both law enforcement and military, that would take a good while as they'd have to weed out their own who turned and then get organized.

Fires would rage through neighborhoods, destroying houses, property, and lives. Fire departments would not be able to keep up, even if they bothered trying rather than protecting their families. 

I'd imagine that in some areas in America, those unaffected would band together and have armed squads keeping strangers out. It would take some time, but gradually the crazed would be put down. With the immediate danger over, the cold hard boot of logistics would fall on the necks of the living. Water would probably be ok as a critical resource that needed to be online immediately, and power would come back up as well in most places where the lines weren't damaged. Food is another matter though. 

Worldwide shipping would all but come to a halt. Covid crippled it for a good chunk of time there and that was no where near as fatal as this would be. Countries would begin to starve and refugees would attempt to flee to other countries for food. This would likely result in war and further death in many scenarios. Even if they had solid arable land, like the US, there would be difficulty in getting that food to everywhere it needed to be. Some people would hoard, other's would steal and hurt or kill others in doing so. The most vulnerable of the remaining population would likely starve. Medication and medical treatment would be severely diminished worldwide, and others would die from that. Gangs of various sorts would form in some areas, possibly for good reason at first, but doing the wrong thing for the right reason wouldn't mollify the wronged who would retaliate, generating more deaths and crimes of all sorts.

Then... there are the bodies. To put it in perspective, the US population is around 328,000,000. That would mean that 32,800,000 people would have gone insane. Let's say that, on average, they managed to kill 3 people each before they were put down themselves. Some would kill more, some would kill less, but 3 seems like a reasonable average. That's 40% of the US population, or 131,200,000 dead, but not buried. For the most part rotting wherever they lay. Rat and insect populations would increase as they had at no point in history. Who knows what diseases would manifest. Maybe we would get to name a brand new plague.

Sure, there would be cleanup attempts... but let's say that the average weight of those over 100 million was around 150 lbs, with children offsetting those over that number. That would be 19.68 **BILLION** pounds of corpses to move and dispose of. Can you imagine the sheer mass of that number? I can't. Although realistically, this would never actually happen in time for the weight to be that much. People would be too concerned with getting their next meal to handle this quickly, and rot would have accounted for a lot of body mass reduction with the added fun of every corpse being a bio hazard to move at that point.

In short, no one who survived this would recognize the world thereafter. At best guess around half of the US population might make it through this. Some countries, like Japan, would probably have more survive and might rebound faster. Many countries would be far, far worse off than the US. There would never be a getting back to normal. Long term, I'd think the focus would be on securing food and distribution lines. Local farming and gardening would be a *major* way of life change that almost everyone would take part in. The disposable culture we live in now might well turn more toward the hoarding end of the spectrum as a lot of goods would just not be produced anymore. Population masses might spread out from centralized city living to being more focused around food sources. 

Manufacturing would probably come back on shore in a big way, which would be great as a ton of jobs would probably cease to exist and, at least for a while, money might cease to mean anything as well. The way we were governed and the laws we live under, as well as their punishments, might change dramatically. It's not impossible for some countries who were ostensibly democratic to have someone seize power in the chaos. Give starving people food and put a little order back in their lives and they're unlikely to complain when you want to keep leading. 

On the up side though, assuming no one got access to nukes or were able to send nuclear power plants into meltdown, the planet would be much better off without so many of us.",1

2746,"I still remember my first one plain as day... We (my partner and I) were dispatched to a rollover in the middle of bum-fuck-nowhere on a late Friday night. The volly fire department out there had gotten on scene before us since we were a good 25-30 minutes out and advised a possible DOA over the radio. I remember the sudden spike of adrenaline coupled with crushing anxiety that, as a rookie EMT, I may or may not be able to handle seeing an actual body mangled beyond recognition. The anticipation for my own reaction alone was enough to turn my stomach.

Anyway, we get there and this car is turned over in the woods after it had clearly took out a MASSIVE pine tree.  Before seeing the body, the first thing I notice is brain matter splattered all inside the windows. The car alarm is still going off and the windshield is completely obliterated but tempered, allowing it to still be somewhat intact. Our guess is that the guy, who wasn't wearing his seatbelt, had hit his head so hard against the windshield upon impact, that it basically exploded. Once we were able to access the inside of the vehicle, we found his body contorted in the backseat. Couldn't see what was left of his head because of the way his torso had hyper-extended (think scorpion). Since my paramedic partner was adamant about obtaining a 4-lead EKG before confirming obvious death, I had to actually get hands-on with the body in order to put on the electrodes. When I picked up the leg, it literally flopped like a giant noodle. The gross factor was intensified by the sound it made... Rice Krispies was definitely not on next day's breakfast menu.

As far as my overall reaction, I was surprisingly fascinated by the condition of the body from an anatomical perspective, all while maintaining professional composure. Come to find out, I fucking love gross shit. I've also learned that the trick in dealing with disturbing calls is to ultimately flip on some sort of ""sociopath switch""-- basically dehumanizing the person by viewing the body alone as a complex meat machine as opposed to a person with an identity. There was a moment where I was challenged when some family photos had fallen out after busting into the rear driver's side window. However, I did what everyone I know in my profession has been taught to do to maintain sanity in those moments: ""Avert your eyes and don't even think about it."" 

Every now and then, I get the occasional flashback of picking brain matter out of my boots and in that moment briefly reflecting on how these slimey clumps once composed this person's thoughts, feelings, and memories... All in all though, I'd say I'm minimally affected by these sorts of calls as far as actual lingering symptoms of PTSD go. If anything, it's the coping mechanism that I, among other professionals in the field, have had to take on in order to do this kind of job which seems to do the most damage. Once you're conditioned to react to things that tug at your emotions through method of avoidance, it does eventually spill over into your personal life. 

For example, one of my biggest problems after 3 years in the service is that I can no longer grieve properly. I compartmentalize things that emotionally trouble me without even realizing it. The first time I noticed was after losing my grandpa to esophageal cancer when I was unable to allow myself to cry and fully process his death without automatically taking a mental detour to a drone-like state.

Sorry I blabbed on. It wasn't for nothing though; I found it to be rather cathartic. I hope this satisfies the answer(s) you were looking for.

EDIT: Added a couple lines to the second paragraph.

EDIT 2: For clarification, my moral compass and ability to feel is still very much intact. In fact, I still hold myself true to the textbook example of an empath... I just suck at letting myself cry. Despite my acquired mental struggles, I cannot express enough how much I love my job and how important it is to me, above all else, to always advocate for my patients.",1

2754,"Russian secret service would obviously intervene to try to protect Putin, as would the locals.

&#x200B;

What the Russian security do if Putin's clearly dead and Biden's clearly alive is anyone's guess.

&#x200B;

After the fact, assuming Biden lives, the locals may not arrest him as heads of state typically enjoy immunity from prosecution.  He certainly wouldn't be taken to Russia in the immediate future.  He'd probably go back to America.

&#x200B;

From Russia's perspective it's an act of war by the United States against them.  The exact response depends on who Putin's successor is.

&#x200B;

From the US perspective there's no automatic removal, but unless it was pre-planned the Vice President (if there is one) almost certainly invokes the 25th amendment immediately and removes him from office temporarily, becoming Acting President.  He would then be impeached, convicted and removed permanently.

&#x200B;

If there is no VP then impeachment would be the only mechanism to remove him, but it would  be done very, very quickly.  If he were flying back from Estonia or Finland it would probably be done before his flight landed - who's going to argue? - with the Speaker stepping up as Acting President.

&#x200B;

Best case scenario, and probably most likely, is that the new President or Acting President performs a grovelling apology to Russia, Biden is either committed, imprisoned for life or executed.  They probably wouldn't extradite him, but if it's the only thing stopping a way, who knows.  There are massive reparations, and the US turns a blind eye to a lot of Russian aggression in future.

2755,"The obese person would live longer because he has a large store of fat which he can metabolize for energy. However, he would still eventually die due to ketoacidoses. 
The brain typically relies upon glucose for fuel. The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen, but after about two days of fasting, it runs out. At that point, the brain begins to rely on ketone bodies for fuel, which are synthesized from fat. The problem is, ketone bodies are acidic, and the ph of your blood eventually gets so low that it kills you. This actually happens to people with diabetes a lot.

While this puts a cap on the amount of time you can survive without food, people who are skinny and do not have ample fat will last a shorter amount of time since they can’t prolong themselves with ketone bodies. A skinny person will probably die of heart or liver failure, since his body will resort to metabolizing amino acids for energy, which he will get from the proteins in his skeletal muscle and organs.

I should note that I’m not a doctor or anything, but I learned about this in a biochemistry class. I might have gotten a few details wrong.

Edit: apparently there have been instances of people fasting for super long times without entering ketoacidosis. It’s more like a potential problem rather than an inevitability.

 “Starvation usually produces a mild metabolic acidosis, but when combined with physiologic stress, starvation may cause a severe metabolic acidosis.” Toth HL, Greenbaum LA. Severe acidosis caused by starvation and stress. Am J Kidney Dis. 2003;42(5):E16–E19. doi:10.1016/j.ajkd.2003.07.012

The principle that the body shifts its metabolism to ketosis during starvation is correct, but I was wrong that it would lower the blood’s ph to a dangerous level without exception. Theoretically, an obese person could survive for a period of time proportional to his fat stores. 

What I said about the skinny person is accurate.",1

2758,"Very far. We've only just started to be able to create very primitive cybernetics. While the technology is advancing pretty quickly, full-on ""brain-in-a-jar""-type morphological freedom I'd say is probably at least a century out. The main obstacles we would need to overcome first are proving that the brain can survive outside the body for an extended period of time, or at least enough time that it can be placed into a new body and proving that all our sensory stimuli (sight, hearing, touch, etc.) can be swapped out for synthetic replacements with fidelities that meet or exceed that of baseline humans.

In terms of which organ system would be hardest to replace, It may not be the case that one is necessarily harder than the other. Artificial hearts, lungs, kidneys, etc. are all things that exist *today*. Considering that the quality of these devices will only get better, the difficulty may not lie in making the organs themselves, but in linking them together in a way that they can be controlled and affected the rest of the body. Organ systems are extremely complex and  closely interwoven things, interacting with each other in ways that could be considered a kind of intelligence. Our early cybernetic organ systems may not be able to account for these kinds of nuances. 

Early versions of this technology may rely heavily on biomechatronics and mostly mechanically-based organ systems requiring frequent maintenance and service (for example, endocrine sacs needing to refilled with the hormone they're supposed to secrete). More advanced versions may leverage genetic engineering tech to create more organic body designs, with a greater degree of self-sustainability (think organ printing, stem cell tech). Extremely advanced levels of this technology may combine genetic engineering with molecular nanotechnology (""bionano"" in Orion's arm-speak) to create extremely high-functioning and efficient bodies and organ systems that blur the line between organic and artifical.

The implications of this kind of technology are pretty clear - extremely high levels of morphological freedom, or in other words, the ability to look like basically whatever you want. Maybe you want the physique of an ancient Greek athlete with enhanced strength and speed, maybe you want to live an exact physical body replica of 1993 Danny Devito, maybe you want to live in the body of a giant, flying, rainbow-colored, quadrotor turtle. Your appearance may really be only limited by your imagination. 

Without structural and functional alterations to the brain, there may be some limits on *extremely* foreign body plans (eg, multiple parts of a body spread out in different locations, bodies with high amounts of extra limbs or high-bandwidth sensory inputs) however the brain is a highly plastic thing and I suspect most people will be able to adjust to a roughly anthropomorphic form with reasonable ease.

Additionally this technology may be limited by factors like cost and accessibility. While it may become commonplace in the future, the surgery that would facilitate this technology would still be profoundly invasive, complex and time-consuming. The first people to gain access to it are likely to be militaries (DARPA is already deeply immersed in BCI and cybernetics reasearch) looking to find ways to enhance their troops or to help them regain body functionality lost in combat. After that, it would likely trickle down to be applied to broader medical purposes, used in cases where the body has been catastrophically impaired (malignant cancers that have spread to multiple organs, accidents in which most of the body has been destroyed). Purely recreational use may come very late or not at all (people generally aren't willing to discard their entire body just to look different)

But again, this is all very far off. Fully functional neuroprosthetics with two-way neural communication likely won't be achieved for another decade or two, and total somatic replacement is light-years beyond that.",1

Clementine Barnabet murdered families, Mariam Soulakiotis murdered women for financial reasons and killed many children through neglect and torture,  Jeanne Webber strangled male but mostly female children in her care.

These are only some of the most profilic serial killers who murdered people of the same sex, but there are many more cases. Reasons for the discrepancy include:

\-many serial killers are motivated by sexual reasons, so of course they murder the people that fit their attraction (which are mostly, though not always as shown above, of the opposite sex)

\-some serial killers murder for financial reasons, which means that they often choose victims whose trust they can gain easily or who do not have many relatives who could miss them, regardless of sex

2778,"Paramedic here. Most drugs (and for the same reason, most poisons) have what's called a biological half life. This is essentially the time it takes for your body to eliminate half of a present substance. The poison or antidote will pretty much keep doing its thing for the duration of its effect. 

Lemme give you an example. One I see often is opiate overdose. As you may know, the ""antidote"" in this case is narcan. It acts by blocking the receptors in the body that absorb opiates. If you were to give someone narcan and then a bunch of fentanyl, chances are they'd have minimal effects from the opiate, as the narcan is still blocking your receptors. However, many opiates have longer biological half lives than that of narcan, which results in needing another hit of narcan once the first dose wears off to deal with the continuing metabolism of the opiate. 

In my experience, similar properties apply to other poisons. Hope this answered your question, stay safe.

2796,"Firstly, I’m so sorry for the loss of your cousin. To lose someone so suddenly and unexpectedly is incredibly difficult and I hope you have a strong support network with friends and/or family. 

To answer your question, I am a mortuary technician, and so will try to help you using my experiences. 

When someone passes away, after perhaps a week or so, the eyes will naturally sink in as the tissue breakdown processes begin. Sometimes, morticians and undertakers use tiny plastic caps under the eyelids to make the eyes looks rounder and fuller, but it sounds like these weren’t used for your cousin. 

Another thing is that when we reconstruct the deceased in death, we don’t know what they looked like in life because we didn’t know the person. This makes things difficult in terms of how to part their hair, did they smile like that, did the wrinkles in their face crease that way or differently, would their eyes shut like that or was there more definition in the cheeks? It’s all guesswork for us unless we have photos, and this means that these tiny features we may not get quite right mean that the face of the deceased is just not how they would have looked in life. It’s an unfortunate side to the job. 

When we die, all of our muscles relax and there is no tension within our faces, which can make people look very different to when they were alive, as we haven’t seen them in that way before. Again, as tissue breakdown occurs, this can exacerbate the lack of tension. 

Further, when we die, we go very pale as there is no blood circulation. There is also discolouration of the skin after a few days. 

Finally, the fact is that some people just look a lot different in death, and some people look like they could just be sleeping. Some people have mouths that just wont stay shut, or eyes that remain open no matter how much you try to close them. Death is a strange event and some people do look, and I know this sounds odd, a lot more ‘dead’ than other people do.

For example, trans older adults with dementia may forget they transitioned and reidentify with their sex/gender assigned at birth or may experience ‘gender confusion.’""

Now peanut butter while sticky to an extent, is also pretty thick and at room temperature it doesn't flow like a liquid. I would assume submerging an adult human in peanut butter, ignoring allergies, would act like a thick quicksand. It'll suffocate you but you arent really ""drowning"" per say. The amount of peanut butter is just compressing your chest as you sink, eventually using up all of your available oxygen and sealing you in. 

Honey on the other hand is a thick flowing liquid. If you were to submerge a human in it, honey is going to fill in their orifices similar to water and fill the lungs. I assume the stickyness of the honey would make the air sacks in the lungs stick together when decompressed in the act of breathing. So your lungs are working twice as hard to get air in while filling with honey. Assuming this is correct, I imagine it would cause your lungs and airway to burn faster and possibly worse then if it were just water.

If they’re visibly bleeding when the injury occurred they could essentially lose all of their blood volume and die of course. If your chest is crushed your lungs won’t be able to expand and you’ll suffocate. 

However without any visible bleeding, your best bet for survival is having your lower extremities crushed (think of your legs crushed between two cars).  Internal bleeding is not a first line concern of ours. You risk dying when the object is moved (uncrushing) from the build up of lactic acid that occurs when while the circulation was stopped which will kill you quicker than it would take for the rest of your blood to leak out. 

You should be given sodium bicarbonate via IV before the object is removed. That’s our best bet to stabilize the return to circulation to your full body.

When you force yourself to keep your eyes open for any slightly extended period of time, your eyes produce excess tears in order to keep them lubricated. Keeping your eyes lubricated is important because dry eyes are uncomfortable and make it difficult to see. The act of blinking spreads tears and other lubricating fluids across the surface of your eye. 

Your eyes also tear up if any foreign objects pass your eyelid and enter your eye region. These tears, along with the action of blinking, serve to expel said object. Not having your eyelids to A. prevent objects from entering your eye and B. expelling said objects, will lead to a lot of discomfort.

In short, I can’t give you any concrete answer. However, from what I gather, you’re going to be crying a lot with no way to properly get rid of those tears (you need to blink to do that). As long as you’re properly hydrated, you’re not going to run out of tears or anything.

Since the human body adapts to its environment, a person from the tropics will have a different comfortable threshold than someone from the far north or south, in addition to different bodies using energy more or less efficiently, but if we’re splitting the difference for average humanity in every sense of the word it seems to be about 65F in the presence of *zero* additional variables.

To further specify your example, let's say a person is outside in freezing temperatures, with no other adverse weather conditions (i.e. - it's not snowing, raining, etc.).  That person will essentially die from exposure if they just stood there and waited for the inevitable.  First, their extremities would lose blood and they'd develop frostbite.  As frostbite set in, the skin and tissue would rapidly become necrotic and start to creep further and further up the arms and legs.  As the extremities began to die, the body would begin to shut down everything but the most critical components to keep your core temperature from dropping rapidly.  As you continued to lose heat, your body would continue to shut down organ after organ until the heart didn't have enough energy to continue to pump blood to your brain.  

Obviously, this is a general overview that is completely ignoring normal human reactions to frostbite as well as other cold risks/injuries.  The pain would be excruciating which could lead to some form of heart attack.  There's ample risk of serious injuries in cold environments as a result of falling or becoming hypothermic as freezing precipitation melted on your skin.  You could also suffer heat stroke if you overdressed in a cold environment, and could quickly develop pneumonia as your pores opened up to try and cool your core temperature.",1

So casual practitioners are probably cultivating a weak 1st Jhana and feeling happy, whereas a more serious practitioner really dives in all day long.

Failing that, a sex therapist could be a good option too. But chances are, everything is totally normal with your body! In the meantime, I can answer a few of your questions:

* The vagina exists to provide pleasure to the human it's attached to and to enable childbirth. It can also provide pleasure to your partner if you decide to go that route, but **you are absolutely not obligated to ever have sex if you don't want to**.
* The fourchette and vagina do not tear during regular intercourse, under normal circumstances. (And if they did, it would be a bit like accidentally hurting the corner of your mouth—definitely not the end of the world.) The muscles are no more ""forced apart"" during sex than your esophagus is ""forced apart"" when you eat your lunch.
* ""Tightness"" is not something most people with penises are good at gauging. The vagina is never in a fixed state. The cervix rises several inches while aroused, and the width of the vagina can likewise increase. I believe most people can feel the cervix with their fingers even when aroused so again, probably not defective at all.
* The natural tightness at rest makes very little difference to the sexual experience. For that, you will want to practice kegels to improve muscle tone in the pelvic floor. Even vaginas that have had entire babies come out of them can be strong and ""tight"" due to being toned. If you're on the younger side (under 30, let's say), you're probably fine as you are!
* Penises can be thrust at whatever speed and force their owners decide to use. A good partner will be just as excited and concerned about your enjoyment as you are with theirs, and they'll adjust to whatever feels good for you.
* The clitoris has significantly more nerves than the vagina, so it tends to be preferred, but they can work together. Think about how your nose does most of the ""tasting"" when you eat, but how the texture or sensation of the food on your tongue still adds to to the enjoyment of eating your favorite food. It's less fun to smell without eating or eat without smelling, but it can be a really good experience when you combine the two. It's the same with sexual stimulation.",1

3109,"This is called an air embolism and you have to know that you're looking for it before you start the post mortem; you can't just stumble across it.

If you perform the post mortem as normal, you'll just remove the heart and as soon as you cut the tissue, you will introduce air into it. This renders any discovery of the air embolism impossible.

To detect an air embolism, you must perform a test in situ, before you even remove the organs. First, you remove the sternum which lies above the heart. This must be done carefully and gently so to not push any air around inside the body. Then, you use forceps to hold the pericardium, a fibrous sac of connective tissue in which the heart sits. Incise the pericardium to reveal the heart and collect any fluids inside the sac around the heart. Now, fill the pericardium with water, holding the sides of the sac high, so you can completely fill the sac with water and fully submerge the heart. Once this is complete, you make an incision into the right atrium and the right ventricle, both separately; if an air embolism is present, it will be in the right side of the heart, and the air that killed the deceased will escape from the heart as a bubble that you will be able to spot floating up in the water-filled pericardial sac.

It's difficult to describe the test, so I hope that I've made some sense. The take home message is that to find an air embolism, you must be prepared to look for one and perform a detailed and fiddly test. However, the investigation around the death is vigorous, and during any post mortem, a thorough external examination will be performed and will flag up puncture wounds. Plus, it would be unlikely for you to be able to inject someone without them being subdued in some way; if through drugs or alcohol, this will be flagged up during toxicology testing, or if through more violent means, physical examination will reveal this. So whilst pathologically, the air embolism isn't obvious, the other procedures surrounding death would raise concerns about the death.

3127,"Didn’t read the novel but here’s a wild guess 

Miggs probably suffered from sexual abuse in his past. Later in life he molested future victims after his sexual trauma made him go insane, which landed him in prison. So Hannibal probably was taking a stab at the part of miggs that most insane people deal with in his own head: “is it the manic, black-out version of miggs that molested another child, OR did the real miggs want that child?”. Basically ppl with mental health issues, also struggle with not being themselves when they experience negative sociological symptoms, and don’t know how to process the psychology behind it. You often ask “is this me, or my trauma and my mental illness”? 

This is the question that Miggs struggled with the most. He didn’t want himself to be the ‘real’ perpetrator of his crime SO BAD. He wishes the urge was never there to “make” him do it. Thus, he continually and compulsively escaped into a sexual world of denial, I’m guessing involving fantasies with mature and confident women, or whatever image that meant the opposite of a young boy to him. 

Miggs is clearly in denial and fighting it hard. All Hannibal had to do, was tell it to his face. My guess, is that Hannibal told him something along the lines of that it was MIGGS who “did it” (raped a young child). 

Miggs spent years in prison trying to separate himself from the crime because, in a sick and twisted way, masturbating is the only way that puts you in control of your mental illness, an illness that sprouted out of a trauma event that MIGGS felt “took him out of himself” in the first place. 

Sometimes you “feel” like it’s not your fault that you were a criminal. In your head, it’s oftentimes being a victim in itself that can lead to your actions. Masturbating is Migg’s mechanism of trying to separate his criminal self from his victim self for validation. But he also is running (masturbating) from the fact that it WAS him who physically did it (the child rape). He can’t masturbate the truth away. No matter how many women he thinks of, he still knows those urges to rape are there. Whether the urges are his fault or not, the crimes are his fault. After years of fighting denial, the truth was too much, after so much effort of suppressing. Years of continuous suppression, what does it do other than bide time? He self mutilates, and kills himself.

I only guess this, because it seems to complete a foil to the main antagonist of the film, who mutilates other people. It’s obviously also a foil to Hannibal himself who eats his victims. 

Buffalo Bill isn’t in denial in the way miggs is, but rather idealizes it instead. BB covets other men who, let’s face it, most likely were molested at an early age themselves. So BB and miggs are opposites because BB murders out of jealousy due to most likely social isolation, and being rejected socially. Where as miggs probably experienced social isolation because he chose to be alone, because his wiring was altered after his early childhood trauma event. BBs victim hood is a more slow process involving bullying/rejection from family, friends, and romantic interests. Where as miggs would’ve never pursued those relationships snd was stunted early on. 

BB also takes out his denial on a woman contrasting to miggs. BB idealizing transgenderism is nothing more than controlling his inevitable rejection by women. Being transgender means BB gets to reject all women FIRST. Then he takes it a step further, and neurotically attempts to be “better” than women and all encompassing of them by sewing skins and playing god. This is contrasting to the mind game of Miggs relentless control mechanism, which takes place only in his head. Miggs is trying to control himself, BB is trying to control women.

And bodies come apart easily; if you've ever cut up a chicken, you can imagine how readily people's hands and feet come off. Just a little while ago, there was a piece in the news about how a captured shark vomited up an arm.

3135,"So there's a lot of circlejerk comments here that are frankly outright wrong, such as /u/BlackmoonL1's which shows absolutely no knowledge of the ethics process in research.

I cannot speak for slaughterhouses, but speaking as a STEM major, there are tight regulations on how lab rats, mice and other animals are treated. And when I say tight, I mean TIGHT.

For example, my friend in Canada -- her job was to clean out cages and take out each rat and cuddle it for a set amount of time each and every single day, because rats had to be socialised under law either with people for X amount of time, or with other rats.

Likewise in Australia, my pharmacology professor had to inject rats with something to see how it interacted with receptors in the brain. The problem was, anaesthesia interfered with these receptors. The ethics committee preferred to nix the experiments entirely rather than allow it to go ahead -- it was only when my professor demonstrated an ethical way to put the rats down without distressing or inflicting pain on them that they gave it the green light, and they had to watch it first hand. (It involved rocking the animal into a trance and then abruptly guillotining them.)

There's also strict regulations on how an animal is put to sleep -- you have to separate the rat from other rats, take it into a separate soundproof room out of view of every other rat, and put it to sleep there. You then have to remove the body, and then clean every surface it touched with a bleach solution and change out your gloves before you bring in another animal and do the same thing. Every. Single. Surface. Every. Single. Time. You also have to ""practice"" euthanasia with every single rat so it's not distressed when it's actually put to sleep. So my professor who had to guillotine rats? She had to put down dozens of rats, and clean up the blood between every single rat and clean the guillotine every single time between rats.

There's also limits on how many animals you use. They will not let you use animals unless you have no other choice -- they will ask you to justify not using cell cultures, organ cultures, etc. They will not let you use a single animal more than you can justify -- if you can only justify using 10, you are not allowed to use 11, you may only use 10. You also have to justify using *that* particular animal -- for example, the rats in my professor's example had a specific receptor that reacted similarly in humans. She could not use any animal for shits and giggles, she had to write a whole proposal justifying how many rats she used and why, how they would be treated, etc etc. She also taught us methods of testing certain things on rats (such as painkillers) and how important it was for the rats to be able to escape painful stimuli *as soon as* it got painful, and if it got to the point where damage was inflicted without causing the animal pain the entire experiment would be immediately called off because it meant *you seriously fucked up*.

Even then, with all those ethical considerations?

**Researchers do not like experimenting with animals.**

My professor hated it and got out as soon as possible. Every single one of her colleagues hated it and got out as soon as possible. My friend switched careers and went to law school. Nobody lasts in animal testing. **Nobody**.

Contrary to popular belief, people who work on animal testing are not moustache twirling villains. Even with all the precautions there are, *they fucking hate working in animal testing*.

Historically, there has been a lot of animal abuse in medical research. Today, university ethics committees take the approach where if there is the slightest sliver of doubt, they will reject your proposal entirely rather than risk suffering.",1

I saw him and asked the attendant if we could see him. She opened the cage and he came up to me and sniffed my hand and rubbed his face on my hand. I moved closer to the cage and he leaned up against my chest and purred while I pet him. So of course he was the one. 

Two years later, he follows me around my apartment always sitting next to me. At night when I climb into bed he will be hanging out in the living room while I browse my phone. As soon as I put my phone down and turn off the light, I flip to my right side. Every night since I’ve had him, he runs and jumps into my bed and lays down next to my chest, head resting on my arm. He will lay there until I fall asleep. Every morning, when I wake up he will hear me toss in my bed and run and jump in my bed to greet me. In an otherwise dynamic world that is always changing, he’s been the one constant keeping me grounded.

So yeah, I do that too.

Some countries have rulers. The people don't choose them and have no say. That's an easy one to figure out. 

Other countries, the ones I assume you're talking about, elect their leaders. 

In places where leaders are elected, rich people and businesses use their money to support the campaigns of the people who are beneficial to their interests. 

Also, people, in general, don't know shit about politics, and don't care. They find a group that agrees with them on a few things that are important to them, and that's what they vote for. 

Those groups usually have a few very agreeable positions to earn votes, and they have many fucked up positions to continue to earn money from donations. 

Because of all this, the organization can continue to rake in money and receive support, while actively working against the majority of their supporters.

3182,"There's an element of the fact that the west is generally on Ukraine's side, and that we're therefore seeing a Ukraine-centric perspective

But at the same time, the maps don't lie: Russia was expected to roll Ukraine over in a matter of days or weeks, yet is now 7 weeks into the war and have clearly not steamrolled Ukraine or even achieved their likely/apparent goals

There's no way around the fact that Russia clearly (despite their new ""You didn't dump me, I dumped you, I didn't even want to date you in the first place"" narrative) wanted to take Kyiv and enforce regime change. And not only did they not achieve that in the first few days as they clearly expected, and not only have they not achieved it at all... but they've even retreated away from the area and given up on the objective entirely. There's no way to realistically paint that as anything other than an abjact failure

Even if this had been a near-peer conflict (a war between two sides expected to be of roughly equal strength) then the attacker would expected to achieve some major objectives, otherwise why are they attacking at all? But Russia was one of the most feared militaries on the planet and Ukraine barely even a blip on the regional map, and Ukraine fought them to a standstill well short of Russia's objectives.

That's not to say Russia can't get anything out of this war or will have entirely failed - but thus far they've tanked their economy and killed 5-10k of their own men, shattered their military reputation on the world stage, united NATO and the EU, started Germany on a re-militarization path, pushed Finland and Sweden into NATO's hands, and is still nowhere near to even achieving their ""fallback"" goals of taking the entirety of Donbas.

It's possible that Russia could have a successful offensive in the east and take the rest of Donbas and secure Mariupol (which looks inevitable), on top of the canal supplying Crimea's water which has already been captured. You could consider that Russia has, at that point, achieved enough objectives to be worth the invasion - but the cost for that has been huge and it's hard to argue that it's been worthwhile

The only thing Russia has *really* achieved is to secure the Crimean water supply, and to ensure Ukraine doesn't join NATO... but that was already off the table since 2014, all Russia had to do was continue quietly supporting the existing war in Donbas and Ukraine was going to stay out of NATO anyway",1

When we say Musk is worth 200B, most of that is assets. His liquid wealth, while still substantial, is likely much much smaller, maybe a few hundred million. You also must understand that money is not the same to the wealthy as it is to us. Money for them is a tool used to create more wealth. Anything which diminishes that tool must be minimized in order to maximize the usefulness of the tool. Basically we have a few motivating factors here, one is the desire to sustain a lavish lifestyle utilizing a much smaller amount of liquid assets, so paying 25% of 300 million will actually lower their ability to own all those fancy houses and yachts and rub elbows with politicians and officials. Second, is the desire to utilize wealth to productively to make more wealth. While a few million less may not be substantial, those few million may be worth 10x or 100x if properly invested, so the pain of that tax is many times multiples. Third the desire to avoid taxes on assets which is a whole separate discussion around property rights, but when 98% percent of your worth is in assets, you sure don’t want that to happen.",1

3193,"As someone who's gone thru something similar also in Eastern Europe in the 90s here's some practical advice to get you thru:


1) A running joke at that time but also 100% accurate is: ""You just need 2 things to survive, your life and your passport"".


Have your documents ready. Passport is king, but university/high school/education diplomas/immunization records...Anything that vouchers for who you are what you have accomplished will help you get thru borders or refugee camps or visas. If you leave your place and you can carry only one thing it's documentation.


2) Fill up your bathroom tub with water. You can drain it as needed for personal hygiene as long as you have running water but always have it full afterwards if you do not know when you're going to lose it. 


3) go get gasoline. Fill up your car if you have one. And buy canisters and fill them up. Gas is worth more than gold when stations run dry. And they will. People will kill each other over it so hide it and don't tell anyone you have it. You can use it for your own needs, you can sell it later, you can trade it. Cash won't be worth much as inflation is going to render cash worthless. Gas will be the new cash. And if you did put it in your vehicle someone will siphon it out quickly. So hide the car too :)


4) go get candles. Better and cheaper than batteries. Can be somewhat reused as long as you keep the wax.


5) go buy a tub of lard. It's winter so it'll keep for a while if power runs out and shouldn't be expensive now. Get lots of crackers and if you can, paprika powder. Crackers + lard + paprika = tons of calories and tastes ok. You can also take this stuff with you if you need to make a getaway.


6) list is getting long and there are many nice to haves but your life is most important so if you can get one more thing get bags of nuts. Walnuts/peanuts/whatever-you-can get-your-hands-on nuts = calories (and they won't spoil)


Now you have water and calories and light. With gas and paperwork you're better off than most people in the same situation. So be careful who you share that with.

Last note to hopefully put your mind at ease, the invading force will go after militarily targets first. Stay clear and you'll be relatively safe. If you find that you must run...lie, cheat and trust very few (if any) as you make your run. Unless there are genocidal atrocities (rare, but happen) you will make it.

I am not in denial that shitty things still happen to good people either. It's a big hot topic in schools right now to help children be resilient and we do that whenever opportunities arise.  But as adults we are in control of how we explain the mythology of Santa and set up whatever traditions we want to follow. Let's just be mindful and show a little empathy while we do so. At our house Santa gives one modest gift and fills your stocking, everything else is from family and friends.

3318,"Cursive is a product of a time when you could be spending many hours each day just writing. Before everyone had a computer, it was common that you had to draw up neat documents or term papers by hand writing. It's easier to do this in cursive because you don't have to lift the pen from the paper as often, which is easier on your hands.

Also, in pre-Victorian times (think Jane Austen) paper was expensive. People would often fit multiple sheets' worth of information onto one sheet by crossing their lines -- writing like normal on one page, portrait oriented, then turning the paper 90 degrees and writing again landscape on top of the portrait-oriented text. The result looked like a grid. But the thing is, because of the way our brains work, this is actually legible in cursive because our brains naturally filter out the vertical text and decipher the words until we turn the paper. This works with cursive, but doesn't work with print.

Cursive is not a necessity in the modern world, but the curriculum just hasn't been updated.

Edit: Nah, y'all are right, it's not that cursive is no longer relevant - it's true there are still applications for it. Just, MOST people don't strictly need it day to day any longer and have the option of opting out of using it. I think it's important to learn it as a child even if you don't use it later, because it at least teaches you to read cursive. And if you want to pick it up again as an adult it's easier if you already have the muscle memory. 

TBH I actually write in cursive and I find it useful, but I do find that more and more people can't read my handwriting. Which is sad because I struggle to write in print and my disability makes it harder to print than to write cursive.

Oh and for those who were interested, you can Google ""crossed lines letter"" to see examples.

If she's a lab then the fact that you exist creates a bond. They're generally *extremely* friendly dogs, so you don't have to actually do a whole lot other than feed her and she'll think you're awesome. Playing would be high on her list of things to do as well. Fetch will probably be her favorite activity since labs, and their cousins golden retrievers, absolutely *love* to bring things back to their person. She'll easily do that for as long as you want to throw a ball for her. Walks would be good too, though she'll probably want to stop and sniff everything that a squirrel or neighborhood cat has ever come near.

>Doggo is frightened and scared when I saw her. Finally got her to eat when I got on the floor, rolled over to show my belly.

The fact that you got her to calm down and eat is a great start. Good job!

Make sure you get her some toys if she doesn't already have any. Labs are smart and if they don't have something to do they'll get bored and can be destructive and start chewing on things.

3338,"There are three things that must be true for voting:

1. It must be accurate- each voter must be able to vote exactly once and their vote must be correctly recorded
2. It must be anonymous- no one must be able to tell who voted for which candidate, so you can't be pressured to vote a particular way.
3. It must be verifiable- all sides involved must be able to verify that the first two things are true. You shouldn't need to trust anyone

The problem with online voting is number 3. There's no way to make sure that your vote is accurately recorded without being able to trace your individual vote. With traditional voting, there are observers seeing with their own eyes that things are being done correctly. But you can't observe an online vote. Even if I show you a computer program that counts votes correctly, there's no way for me to prove that the computer program running on the server is the same program I showed you, or that there isn't some other program off to the side messing with the data. 

The reason online banking works is because it doesn't care about being anonymous- every transaction you make is tied to your identity. You can see every transaction made in your name and verify them after the fact, even on the phone or in a brink and mortar bank if you don't trust the computer and you can contest any discrepancies. But that can't be allowed in voting.

3365,"So a lot of people are missing some crucial pieces here, but here's the whole summary: 

1. Unexpected things. A lot of people did touch on this. Sometimes the patient prior to you drops a bomb mid-appt or even worse, when your hand is on the door to leave. If someone is here for wrist pain and then goes ""oh yeah doc...my chest hurts real bad every time I exercise."" You cannot ignore that, they could have a life threatening concern. So now your 15 min appt becomes 30. 


2. Other people running late. I don't mean just patients. A clinic involves a LOT of people. Patients, front desk, nurses, MAs, etc etc. If one runs late, so do the others.


3. Paperwork. Y'all are seriously underestimating how much paperwork needs to be done. Every single patient has to have a note typed out, a diagnosis (usually multiple) made, everything you order has to be justified and associated with a diagnosis (even things like flu shots or med reorders), every thing you order has to be confirmed as correct, meds and lab work have to be confirmed to the correct insurance, you might have to get a print out of your referrals/visit summary. Doctors work very very hard to do as much of this as they go, but it cannot always be done. Also, lots of people get annoyed if a doctor is typing while they talk, so then you cannot do any of this as you go.


3. They don't make the schedule. The majority of doctors are not in charge of booking patients, they hire people specifically for that. Doctors get over booked, and because the clinic or hospital they work for cares about $$$, they make doctors see as many people as possible. Doctors usually have set amounts of time depending on the appt type, and you can't always just add a random 10 minutes here or there. I promise you the majority of doctors would rather have more time to talk to you too and aren't trying to just see you as a cash cow, but it is literally out of their control. 


4. You can (technically) wait to be seen, they can't wait to see people. Does it suck if you've been living with indigestion and your appointment to finally see the doctor about it got canceled? Absolutely and it's okay to be mad about that. But nobody died from an upset stomach, and as aforementioned, late patients simply have no room in the schedule because it's tightly regulated. If what you tell the office you need to be seen for is important enough the doctor won't cancel your appointment. (And now you're why the next patient is being seen late, but see 1. Unexpected Stuff)


5. A lot of offices still really push to get late people in. We really want to see you, and we'll do what we can, but it isn't always possible. 


6. Doctors have lives too. Every late appointment makes it harder and harder to get home on time, eat lunch, pee, etc. Doctors don't owe you their well being. 


I probably missed some stuff but the way medical offices run is a pretty complex issue and while it could be handled better, a lot of it has nothing to do with the doctor. If your doctor always runs late in that bothers you, go see a new one, but I promise most of them are trying their best to keep everybody happy, including themselves.",1

Its not that hard to shift your sleep cycle.  It wouldn't be great to be sleeping on the floor but if you were doing that I think you could last quite a while

You are making 8 x $100 = $800 a day

$800 x 7 = $5,600 a week

$800 x 30 = $24,000 a month

I think I could bang out a fair few month and put together quite a sum of money.

Edit for more thoughts:

OP gives more details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/xqibik/comment/iq9c8gs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and in other replies (in particular saying yes to sleep and that it is a 9-to-5 shift)

So its $800 x 365 = $292,000 a year (less taxes?).

Since you are sleeping, you could pursue some other form of employment in your off time. though that  might be more for the sake of keeping yourself busy than anything else, and you might be better off studying or otherwise preparing yourself for leaving this weird lifestyle you now live in the best possible position.

The more I think about this, the more it seems like someone who is young with few responsibilities could do this for quite a long period (perhaps years). I'm assuming that for the vast majority of people reading that the above income would be a major upgrade to their income.

So thinking of reasons you would stop taking this deal (not an exhaustive list):

* Body Breakdown. I think sleeping on a bare floor is survivable for a long time.  Especially if you can afford help with massage and stretching etc.
* Social Life.  This would wear on you.  You're missing 9 to 5 every day including weekends.  You'll be coming in late to weddings (likely just the reception) and parties etc.  I think if your friends were aware of your weird bargain they would play along but it would definitely be a negative
* Medical Emergencies.  Either you or a loved one having a medical emergency is something that likely would break the streak.
* Death of a loved one.  Again this is likely going to break your streak.
* Family commitments.  So if you already had a partner and especially if you had young children this feels like it would make it a lot harder to pull off.  Especially if kid-related emergencies come up.
* Traffic, or car problems.  This would be the super frustrating thing.  It sounds like OP intends that if you don't turn up on time it would break the rules and break the bargain.  Having something screw up so you can't *get* to this facility might eventually happen, especially if you are looking at doing this for the longer term (months or years)

Edit for potential game changer. Do weekends exist in this scenario?

* If we assume you can take weekends off the yearly income becomes roughly $208,000
* But now you can lift a lot of the social life and family commitment pressures. It also means you can unlock some short travel opportunities (though that is playing with fire if something goes wrong)

Edit for a question that is being asked

Is there a bathroom? It sounds like the answer is no

* Its an 8 hour shift where you are sleeping most of it
* Getting through that without pooping should be quite feasible (if making for the occasional uncomfortable day)
* With your lunch option you can add the option for relieving yourself in whatever held your beverage.

Edit because it keeps getting said

* Yes you should probably assume you would be taxed on this.  

Another Edit:

* Yes the OP does not specify the time of day.  But if you look at OP's replies elsewhere (I linked one above) they do specify its a 9-to-5.",1
3374,"You're watching movies that were released in 5.1 surround, but on a stereo system (like a TV, or computer speakers). The stereo system is doing a poor job of ""re-mixing"" the 5.1 sound for stereo. There's usually a setting for this on the TV or on the movie player (DVD player, games console, etc), usually called something like ""Speaker Setup"" or ""demux"" if it's a fancy player, and it'll let you choose between e.g. speakers, soundbar, headphones...

In a 5.1 movie mix, the dialogue is usually positioned in the front-centre speaker, because the dialogue is almost always happening on-screen and should take priority over anything else the audience hears. Music usually appears in the front-left and front-right speakers, and effects can come from anywhere. When a stereo system mixes those 5 speakers together, it usually just squashes the front-left and rear-left signals together, the front-right and rear-right signals together, applying ""compression"" to the signals. This isn't like MP3 compression, it's an audio effect that makes quiet sounds louder, but doesn't affect loud sounds. This is to make up for the fact that your TV speakers probably aren't as loud as the speakers in a cinema.

It then plays the centre signal across both speakers, but reduces the level of the centre signal to compensate for it now appearing in two speakers. And sometimes, the centre signal gets reduced too much, and is drowned out by the compressed music and effects, which results in the dialogue being hard to hear.

But like I say, your TV or player device or even things like VLC give you some control over how the 5.1 signal is mixed, and how much compression should be applied.

---

This is now my most popular comment ever. Thanks for all the upvotes, and kind strangers for the awards. Here's some FAQs from my inbox:

**I have a 5.1 surround system, and I still get this problem.**

Boost the volume of your centre speaker. Ideally, get your system calibrated. If it was an expensive system, the shop that sold it to you should do this for you. If it wasn't expensive, there are online guides and phone apps that will help you.

**But I thought audio compression made loud sounds quieter, not the other way around?**

There are two kinds of compressors. A _downward_ compressor is the more well-known, and people who are familiar with recording audio will be most familiar with downwards compressors. These do indeed work by attenuating the signal when it goes above a given threshold, i.e. making the loud sounds quieter. But they give a different character to the signal above the threshold, which is great for making a kick drum sound massive while ensuring that it doesn't clip the recorder, but it isn't what we want here. 

Since the signal from a DVD has already been recorded and mixed by a professional, we know that it sounds great, so we don't want to alter the peaks in the signal, we _only_ want to amplify the low level sounds. For that, we need an _upward_ compressor. This works exactly as I describe; by raising the level of signals below a given threshold, i.e. making quiet sounds louder. You hardly ever find them in recording studios, but they're very common in broadcast audio and in hi-fi devices, which is what you'd classify a DVD player as.

Note that upward compressors are not just downward compressors with make-up gain. They're a completely different circuit design or algorithm.",1

3410,"It is almost certainly purposefully vague both because they're both intertwined. It's not a simple answer.

The phrase was *initially* popularized by Biggie Smalls in the song [""Get Money.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7AGFAcwY3U) The song is about being betrayed by a woman, but also how he enjoys women in much the same way. It's a consistent theme throughout his music. He talks about being misogynistic, while also legitimately being in love, while also being a victim himself because he falls in love with very flawed women, all together. The hook is ""Fuck bitches, get money"". This hook would infamously be mocked on 2Pac's diss song [""Hit Em Up.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU)

The best example of this (and maybe my favorite Biggie song) is [""Me and My Bitch""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rueScMSnRP4). At the start he says ""Me and my bitch"" like a young kid with an arm piece, bragging. Then he says ""Me and my bitch"" in the second verse, using bitch as an almost empowering term, like yeah she's a bad bitch who stands her ground and I like her for that. Then in the third verse, where he finds her murdered, he's crying ""Me and my bitch"", saying it ironically and painfully nostalgically because at this point he truly loved her *because* she was rough around the edges.

This is the same in ""Get Money."" He switches back and forth in the song. Some of the lines are about him fucking bitches, others about getting money, others about being betrayed by women (fuck bitches).

But it doesn't stop there. In 2005, Lil Wayne released [""Money On My Mind""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ffu7u9gvSU) on Tha Carter II in which the hook references the ""Fuck Bitches, Get Money"" line from the Biggie Song. This is where it became memed on the internet, and when it became reintroduced to the public, a decade later. And with this line, a lot of the context was lost, and nobody really knew which way it meant because when it first came out (and remember, even still today Biggie is one of the highest selling rap artists of all time along with OutKast, Kanye, Eminem, Tupac and others) specifically because of the reasons I mentioned above.

So, the answer is it's a double entendre on purpose. Neither one is the right answer. Thus, the genius of Christopher George Latore Wallace aka Notorious B.I.G.

Hey, I figured it out partially and I got chills man.

It's ASCII.

After translating it, it reads:

38 34 32 34 39 39 2e 37 38 2d 20 34 31 35 34 30 36 2e 36 33 20 67 61 62 20 64 65 72 20 61 20 6e 69 u r alone now dont come after me

Do these numbers mean anything to you?

Man, I got the CHILLS.

It would help if you could tell us where you live (country) or if there's anything near you. Maybe figure out what the significance of these numbers are. Also it feels like there's someone who thinks that you are after THEM. So maybe it's got to do with where you park every day, or a place you pass by regularly, and someone recognizes your car?

EDIT: (compiling data) (clarifications)

The string of numbers then translates to ""842499.78- 415406.63 gab der a ni""
which reads 'in a red bag 36.064514 -87.994248' backwards (Thanks, u/Nrutasnz)

The coordinates point to the middle of Tibet, China. A place which is impossible to Google Map due to the restrictions on data. Might have to use Bai Du or something.

Shuanghu, Nagqu, Tibet, China https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/36%C2%B003'52.3%22N+87%C2%B059'39.3%22E/@36.0700036,87.943404,28944m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d36.064514!4d87.994248

For people getting results in the middle of Michigan, remember that for google maps, the proper way to insert coordinates is with a comma. I had to change the string from (36.064514 -87.994248) to (36.064514, 87.994248) which then shows up in the very center of China. The placement of the pin feels too exact to be a coincidence, and leads me to believe that the China coordinates are the correct one. It also adds to my theory below. But I'll still admit it's all a big guess!

EDIT 2: (thoughts)

I don't know if this is really the thing, but you mentioned that it was your birthday soon. I live in Asia, and we have a tradition here where we give money to our friends on certain occasions in what we call 'ang bao'. It translates directly to 'red bag', and is also a Chinese tradition. The coordinates lead to as central of China as you can get. Perhaps this is trying to tell you that someone's gonna give you a big fat stack of cash soon.

Or kill you, I dunno.

EDIT 3:
I came to the realisation after that negative coordinates also work. I'm not trying to weasel out of this. I'll put my hand up to the oversight. That said, I would still have figured China due to the very odd pin placement that read far more to me like a purposeful move.

Now that it's solved, congrats OP on your birthday trip to China! You have some good friends indeed.",1

3501,">Shooting into a room full of innocent people as they cower in fear ""is very sadistic,"" O'Toole said. ""And sadistic violence like this is almost exclusively male."" 

>Most men, of course, go through life without killing anyone. And motives for crime are very individual; not all women and men who kill do so for the same reasons. Each case is unique, experts stress. But something in the combination of male biology and socialization makes men more prone to violence. Notably, the gender gap in violence is found in almost every culture around the world, Garbarino said.

>**There are no simple answers. The easiest theory to digest is probably an evolutionary one: Males, over hundreds of thousands of years of development, have historically been rewarded for aggression.** A tendency toward violence is seen in chimpanzees, humans' closest living primate relative. (Bonobos, humanity's other close primate family member, are far more peaceful, though recent research has shown they are drawn to jerks.) Violence can beget status for males, both in chimps and in humans (just look at how many action heroes get the girl). And for males, a lack of status can mean missing out on the chance to mate.

>Indeed, sexual frustration is a theme running through the writings of many male mass shooters, Lankford said. Many shooters leave manifestos explicitly detailing their hatred of women and of men who seemed to navigate relationships with women with ease.

>""By contrast, I'm not aware of any female attackers, even though we have a small sample, I don't know that any of them complained about not being able to have sex,"" Lankford said.    

>Status plays a large role in school shootings, a particularly male phenomenon, said Katherine Newman, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Newman, author of ""Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings"" (Basic Books, 2005), argues that there has never been a typical school shooting with a female perpetrator. A case in San Diego in 1979 involved a teenage girl who lived across from an elementary school and started shooting children and staff from her home one morning. But in cases of random shootings on school grounds by a person who is part of that school's community, the perpetrators are all male, Newman told Live Science.

>These boys and young men may be responding to a cultural script that equates violence with masculinity, Newman said. Most are not loners. Instead, they try to join social groups but struggle. Their experience is one of disappointment and humiliation. So, they decide to trade in their ""loser"" persona for something more appealing, according to Newman.

>""Sadly for all of us, that something more appealing is the role of the antihero,"" Newman said.

>Girls aren't similarly targeted with the notion that becoming a violent antihero is appealing, Newman said. Their reputational struggles play out in other ways, usually involving self-harm or nasty gossip.

>The gap in aggression between girls and boys has narrowed, though, said Garbarino, author of ""See Jane Hit: Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do About It"" (The Penguin Press HC, 2006). More popular media show girls and women acting in violent ways, which provides role models for female aggression, he said.

>Still, the gender gap in lethal violence hasn't shrunk like the gap in general violence, Garbarino said. It's a mystery as to why. Men may be biologically vulnerable: Variations in a gene called MAOA combined with early developmental stressors like abuse or drug use can raise a man's risk of criminality. Men are also more likely than women to base moral decisions on abstract principles rather than on empathy, Garbarino said.

Take a look at [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/mass-shootings-by-country)'s page, ""Mass Shootings by Country 2021""

>For a highly developed and wealthy nation, the United States has an unusually high rate of mass shootings. However, it is a common misconception that it is the worst country globally in terms of mass shooting rates. The truth of the matter is that the United States is number sixty-six on the list of countries in terms of mass shooting rates per capita, but they have had more mass shootings than any other country in terms of overall numbers.",1

Most of the time the rich family admits that they really had no idea how hard it was to live like that, and often they offer to help get the poverty family a better job and stuff.  One even funded the startup costs for the husband in the poverty family to start his own business, and that made a huge difference in their life.",1

3508,"The term ""African-American"" was [introduced by Rev. Jesse Jackson](https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/31/us/african-american-favored-by-many-of-america-s-blacks.html) in the 1980s, who felt that the term ""blacks"" to describe this demographic was too racist and had picked up too many negative connotations.  He wanted a new term to help the black/African-American community to recapture their racial heritage.  The term has since become so ingrained in American discourse that we started to use the ""X - American"" construct for other ethnicities as well, but like Jesse Jackson it is usually because we feel an existing term has too many bad connotations.

Edit: Several people have pointed out that the term ""African-American"" has appeared in writing earlier, even [going back to the 19th century](https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/4216-the-origin-of-african-American), with one citation found [as early as 1782](https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/04/21/the-term-african-american-appears-earlier-than-thought-reporters-notebook/) (hat tip to /u/lithographia).

Intellectual disability ranges vastly in adults with Downs and it's impossible to know whether or not he knew the value of the money he handed you. I would 100% double check to make sure that he realized how much he handed you. Individuals with Downs are often very kind and it's possible he knew it would make you happy but didn't realize the repurcussions of his kindness. i.e. Not having grocery money or money for that cool day trip he has planned for the week with his family or care providers. My brother has done similar things like this before without fully understanding what he is doing (he typically struggles with math as well) despite him being considered very high functioning.

TLDR; Double check with the individual, it's impossible to know if he realized what he was doing. If he did; awesome for you. If not; you may have ensured that he has food this week.

3552,"From a library and information science perspective , religion as a category typically deals with texts that are more of procedural, critical, or explanatory in nature. It's the more explicit instructions, commentary, customs/traditions/rituals, and foundational texts that create the actual practice of a religion. Mythology is made up of cultural stories and can be stories related to a religion but it's going to be written in narrative format which is distinct from informative and critical texts.  There absolutely is Christian and Jewish and Islamic and Hindu and Buddhist and so on and so forth mythology, there are classifications for mythologies from all currently practiced religions as well as classifications for the separate religious texts in modern library systems and that's also true for religions that are no longer practiced.

I realize this isn't exactly an anthropology answer but the ways we organize knowledge in a culture both inform how we talk about those things and is informed by how people were already talking about them when those categories were created. I don't know the exact history of it but I do know that separating those two sides of the religion coin is a thing humans have been doing for a long time at least in modern nations impacted by US library standards bc the knowledge organization systems we currently use are very old. And so, since someone searching for mythology texts would have to go to a different section than when searching for religious texts talking about it as though they're distinct from each other becomes a kind of normal or common.

3646,"A few other commenters on here are correct that “balancing” is a common symptom of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. However, before you freak out, remember that mental health is a spectrum. You can have OCD-like tendencies without being diagnosed with OCD. Generally, something is considered a mental illness when it is distressing, long-lasting and not correlated with any other causes or drugs/medications, you can’t stop it, and it is disruptive to your life in multiple spheres (e.g. family, friends, health, job, school, love life, etc.). With OCD compulsions/obsessions, the DSM-V states that for diagnosis, people must lose at least [an hour of time](https://beyondocd.org/information-for-individuals/clinical-definition-of-ocd) to these per day. 
So, essentially, you may be a bit closer to OCD on the spectrum of things, but not necessarily “over the line” into clinical mental illness. 

*Why is it helpful to know where this line is?*
1. Usually, when you’ve crossed the line into falling into the diagnostic criteria for a mental illness, it means that you are really going through a tough time and you may continue to struggle without some kind of outside intervention or help. 
2. If you *haven’t* crossed the line into clinical OCD, I think it’s nice to know that all behaviour and thought patterns are on a spectrum. You may be different from some people, but there are lots of people out there who experience the same things as you. It’s a big world out there and you are a unique combination of millions of different possibilities. 

Also, if you *don’t* have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder but you have a compulsive tendency like this, you can keep doing it if it doesn’t bother you and isn’t affecting your life and relationships. However, if it bothers you or is affecting your life, even if you *don’t* have OCD, you can still reach out for help, support, or strategies. 

If you *do* find this distressing and think that you might have OCD, talk to your family doctor about getting a referral for a psychiatrist and they can give you better help and more accurate information than self-diagnosis over the internet. 

Tl;dr - a broad spectrum of behaviour differences from person to person is normal. Once a behaviour becomes distressing or disruptive to your life, that’s when you would benefit from outside help.

Edited to add more detail and last paragraph before tl;dr.",1

We depend a lot more on people NOT doing harm than we depend on people committing good. It's a lot more important to me that you not harm me than it is that you do favors for me.

Let's say I give you an option between two roommates.

The first is kind of an ass, but will generally be respectful of your boundaries and won't betray you. They just won't go out of their way to help you out.

The second one will, 95% of the time, do your chores, help you out, lend you money, etc. But 5% of the time they will betray you and be willing to harm you.

I think you'd end up a lot safer with the first roommate than the second.

Finally: most humans believe, not unreasonably, that a single act of evil is a good sign that the person will be willing to do it again. Most people don't sincerely use ""evil"" to mean accidents or even negligence (unless they're speaking abstractly or in hyperbole). They use it to mean intentionally violating someone's rights. Most of our experiences suggest that when someone proves themselves willing to violate social norms enough to outright be evil (which is actually hard for the average person to do, psychologically), they are likely to do so again. So we isolate them to protect ourselves.

The smell of vinegar will go away after it dries, and vinegar is pretty good at neutralizing odors. Baking soda (used separately from vinegar) is also a good odor neutralizer, but I think it would probably scratch up the paint on your wall.

* I have no idea how this pertains to animals with weird shaped poop. Each animal has a different digestive system with unique attributes.

* If you have diarrhea, your feces is moving through you too quickly and doesn't have the chance to form into the shape of your intestines.

* If you have hard pellets, your feces is staying in you too long, so the water in your feces is really low, which stops it from forming to one solid piece that looks like your intestines.

My gut instinct is that this is really hard.

When you google ""womens jeans with deep pockets"", you actually do find a few brands that try this. [Radian Jeans](https://radianjeans.com/pages/about-us) is the first that popped up in my search. 

As for ""oh well why isn't everyone just buying those then"", I'd speculate that lots of women struggle to find jeans that really suit them anyway, even without taking pocket size into account. Therefore ordering jeans online from a brand you've never heard of simply because they have pockets might be too big of a risk to just end up with ill-fitting jeans. That was my thought at least, though admittedly I *am* intrigued to try it.",1

3733,"Ok. When you’re sitting down (or standing, or doing anything except lying flat, really) the weight of your upper body can either be supported by your back muscles or your spine. In reality it’s always a mixture of the two, taking different percentages of your weight from position to position, but we’re going for a simple answer here. 

When your weight is supported by your back muscles, when you’re standing or sitting with good posture, it takes pressure off your vertebrae and the squishy cartilage disks between them. This, however, causes muscle fatigue in your back muscles, especially if you’re sitting or standing in one position without moving or stretching for hours on end. 

When you slouch, your back muscles can relax, and that feels good, but it puts pressure on those delicate cartilage disks again. In the short term there’s nothing wrong with that. A couple minutes, or even a couple hours of bad posture won’t do much. Over months, years, and decades, though, they start to compress and can cause pinched nerves, crooked spines, and all kinds of permanent posture issues. 

I highly recommend adding some body weight exercises that work and stretch your back into your routine. Building stronger muscles stops your back muscles from fatiguing as fast, and stretching sore muscles and tight ligaments feels good and keeps them healthy and flexible.",1
3734,"We actually do more than just brushing! We regularly check the gums and tongue for signs of any infection. Patients in a coma obviously are unable to swallow and clear secretions normally so there is high risk of secretion build up, two things can happen from this. Bacteria can build up, track down the endotrachial tube used for ventilation and cause a hospital acquired pneumonia. Also yeast colonies can form and develop into oral thrush. Both of these are common complications and so most units (certainly where I work in the UK) have what's called a VAP bundle (VAP stands for ventilator acquired pneumonia) and includes sitting patients upright where possible, regular suctuoning of the mouth and throat, regular mouthcare with special hydrating gels, and, of course, regular teeth burnishing. Assuming the patient has teeth. Although if they don't we still do all the other steps!

3746,"They can't just get together and make up their minds because they're both trying to sell you the best version of their product, which is strangely at odds with each other.

The microwave manufacturer wants to sell you on a device with as many functions as possible - it can reheat, defrost, melt, cook entrees, make a baked potato, make hot beverages, cook frozen vegetables, and make popcorn.

Given the choice between all those options and one that just says, ""can cook, rewarm, and defrost food"", the average customer chooses the one that can do 8 things over one that can only do 3 things.

On the other hand, popcorn makers know that the popcorn button won't always make the best popcorn. It's best if the user waits until they're all done popping by listening to when they stop popping and stops the microwave. Using the popcorn button can lead to more unpopped kernels if it doesn't give enough time or burnt popcorn if it's on too long. The microwave can't listen to the popcorn; they just detect humidity.

So, either side loses if they're the one to back down, so neither does and thus the constant battle between microwave makers who insist their device has a dozen functions, including a specialized one for making popcorn, and the popcorn makers who will tell you that you'll get optimal results if you don't use that button.

There is a real possibility of *not* knowing bc in reality there may not be a family history especially w/HD bc of late term presentation and anticipation, a genetic thing that causes those in the family that first get it to become symptomatic very late in life if at all and with each successive generation getting it earlier. 

It’s also been historically difficult to diagnose, with lots of misdiagnosis and social factors that may make family history unknown as well.

The conclusion was that “skin pigmentation is poorly correlated with eyelid transmission; eyelid transmission is most affected by wavelength-independent macromolecules in the eyelid as well as its overall thickness.” In other words, darker eyelids would not block more light than lighter eyelids, and how much light passes through is dependent on other factors like the overall thickness of the eyelid. 

A caveat is that the sample size was only 27 people, so there could be confounding factors. Hypothetically, it’s possible that increased levels of melanin does block more light, but people with lighter skin may have thicker eyelids, which may cause the results they see.

But if the step is half the height or less of the ball, it's possible for it to just roll over the barrier through momentum.

 When you sweep, the dust is doing something similar. It's bouncing and bumping along, impelled by the broom bristles. Any particle that gets some lift will make it into the pan.

But an edge that thin is very sharp knife territory as far as thickness is concerned. And few people would want a razor sharp edge on a dust pan. Second, it has become common for dust pans to have a rubber edge so it can conform to imperfections in the floor better.

So if you have 91 db in Dover, 1 db will remain in Calais (Well technically the closest point isn't exactly in Calais/Dover but you get my point). Assuming that the sound level at the sea-side is between 50-60 DB it would mean that a 150 dB sound in Dover can be heard in Calais.

Second question how many people do you need to shout. Assuming one person can shout at 90dB. The formula for dB is clear everytime you double the intensity you add 3 dB so 2 person 93 dB 4 person 96 dB 8 person 99 dB ---> if you want to add 60 dB you need to that 20 time, so around 1 000 000 people shouting in Dover are  enough to be heard in France

When he came to England with his unit, he brought the bear with him but ended up leaving her at the London Zoo. Christopher Robin visited the zoo with his father and fell in love with Winnie and renamed his bear, Edward after her. Apparently there was a swan at the same zoo called Pooh because of her um ... toilet habits and Christopher added that in to remember her by. Or that's one story.

However, in the movie Goodbye Christopher Robin it's slightly different. Christopher tells his father he wants to rename Edward to Winnie but was worried that people wouldn't understand that Winnie was a boy bear (Winnie was a popular ladies name in England) so Milne suggests he add 'Pooh' to Winnie's name. When Christopher asks why, Milne says something like ""So if someone says that's a boy bear with a girl's name, you can just say 'Pooh!'"" which in Britain was a word used to express disbelief/disdain/dismissal.",1

About ten or fifteen years ago, the people who do safety testing on cars (IIHS, NHTSA) noticed that rollover accidents tended to result in more deaths and serious injuries. They found that this was happening because car roofs tended to deform and collapse in rollovers, smashing directly into the heads of the passengers. So, they came up with a standard for how strong a roof has to be, and implemented crash tests to evaluate this. Automakers realized pretty quickly that one of the easiest and cheapest ways to make a roof stronger is to make the ""A"" pillar a lot thicker. And that's why [modern cars have such thick ""A"" pillars compared to older cars.](http://payload.cargocollective.com/1/2/84448/1064602/pilla1%20copy%20copy.jpg)

If you want to drive a car that looks old but has modern features, there is hope: some people will restore old cars and replace the original parts with modern ones.

Generally, people perform resto-modding with an eye to improving performance: using modern powertrains, modern suspensions, modern brakes, etc. A resto-modded classic car probably won't do any better in an actual crash, but your ability to avoid getting into a crash in the first place would be greatly improved vs. the original, un-modified car.",1

After it was out the surgeon did a little more work, and then we left. Just walked out and left the guy wide open with no liver. Took off the gloves and left the OR.

We went to the lounge and got some snacks and something to drink. I was wondering how long the patient was going to be like that. The surgeon explained that the OR crew had to swap out all the instruments, change out equipment, and prep the new liver. 

So after about 20-30 minutes we headed back and finished. Took another several hours to put the new liver in.

3877,"I remember when reddit first implemented gold, IIRC it was a while after they were bought by Conde Nast, and the impression I got was that they were on their books as a huge money sink with absolutely no income, and in that moment they basically said ""hey guys, we need some money, we don't know what we're offering as compensation, but if you help us out we'll get you back""

And the response was *overwhelming*, they thought they'd put out this option and in a few months they'd have *some* money, but the response was so overwhelming that they came back a day or two later and said ""holy crap! Thanks guys we're good!"" I think they shut the entry window within the week. The compensation they eventually got was reddit gold, at first there were a few cool features, it would show you new comments on threads you'd previously read, you'd get an inbox if your name was /u/ mentioned, there was a special sub you could only get into with gold (totally just shit posting being wealthy and having money to spend on frivolity). 

For people like me, thats what I think of when I think of gold, reddit being in it's beginning, not yet cash positive but with a massive user base that loved it enough to throw cash at it because they wholesomely and genuinely asked and needed it. It makes sense that it would evolve into a more perfunctory, business model, and it does take the soul out of the fun, but remember that at the time, Digg (lol Digg) was making money by selling ads which reddit has done mercifully sparingly, and Ebaums world had a monthly subscription program that was only used by hardcore users. These websites had no way to get money on the books, this novel way of ""hey, the service will be the same regardless, same content, nothing behind a paywall, but if you want to give us money whenever you can whenever you want, we would really appreciate it"" really struck a cord.

3895,"Horses are highly social creatures.  In the wild, they live in herds of up to twenty horses with multiple adult males, and they easily accept new horses.  This is very different from packs of wolves, for example, which only have one adult male and very rarely accept members outside the family.  Horses establish hierarchy in their herds and will defer to (rather than fight) a more dominant horse.

This has many advantages for humans.  First, the horse perceives a human as a peer and accepts their attention as social interaction.  Humans, along with other animals like goats, can fulfill a horse’s need for social attention.  More importantly, a horse will accept a human as the dominant animal.  In the horse’s brain, it perceives the human in the same category as a higher-ranking horse.  This is common to all domesticated animals.  If the animal is unwilling to accept humans as pack members, it isn’t suitable for domestication.

They are also passive enough to accept training (you don’t just jump on a feral horse and ride off on it) and the more aggressive or resistant animals aren’t bred in captivity.  This is in contrast to zebras, who are generally more aggressive and can rarely be trained to tolerate riders.

3940,"There are two theories that address this.

The first argues that having *some* homosexual individuals is good for a society by reducing overpopulation during times of abundance. One of the pieces of evidence for this theory is that one of the factors that correlates with being gay is birth order: the more older ~~siblings~~ brothers you have, the higher a boy's chance of being gay.

The other theory is often called the *Gay Uncle Theory*. This argues that having a homosexual sibling is good for your ability to pass on your genes, because gay siblings are childless relatives. As childless relatives, they will be invested in helping *your* children (who are, after all, their nieces and nephews) survive - perhaps by teaching them, bringing them food, protecting them from predators or adopting them after the deaths of their natural parents. Since you share 25% of your DNA with nieces and nephews, having a gene that made it likely that your relatives would be gay would be a positive trait that natural selection would favour.

There's nothing fundamentally fascist about saying you like vanilla ice cream, and plenty of people who aren't Nazis think vanilla ice cream is great ... but if Nazis started using the term, well, those of us who like vanilla ice cream for the flavor have to start being careful about when we say so.

Same deal with Blue Lives Matter. Fundamentally it's a great sentiment. Of course the lives of our police officers matter! Who could argue otherwise?

There are a few different ways to filter out content you see on reddit:

#**Option 1**: Filtering from /r/all (Works on mobile and desktop) 
-
Reddit allows you to filter out posts from specific subreddits in /r/all, however it's not easy to find. Subreddits can be added to your filter by going to the *desktop* website https://old.reddit.com/r/all/ and the filter will be near the top of the right sidebar. 

Note that you can only make changes to the filter from the old.reddit.com domain, however the actual filter is tied to your account, and will also filter out posts on the mobile app or on the redesigned desktop site. Also note that this filter **only applies to /r/all**, it will not work for /r/popular. There is no natively supported filter for /r/popular. 

#**Option 2**: Filtering from the desktop site
-
If you want to filter more than just /r/all from the desktop site, you can using the browser extention [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com ""also /r/Enhancement""). RES allows you to set site-wide filters based on subreddits, users, domains, flairs, and basically anything else. Filters set through RES will not carry over into the mobile app. If you do browse reddit on desktop, I would highly recommend RES even if you don't need to filter things, as it comes with a plethora of other great features as well. 

#**Option 3**: Filtering on mobile using a 3rd party app
-
While reddit's official mobile app does not support filtering, many of the 3rd party apps available on your respective app store do. There are actually a lot of great features that 3rd party apps have that the official one doesn't, so I would definitely recommend checking them out. There are a lot of great 3rd party apps out there, and everyone has different tastes, so I would recommend trying out a few of the high rated apps, and see which one you like the most before sticking with it. Here are some 3rd party apps that I know of that support filtering, although I'm sure many others do as well:

3967,"They would not work in the same way they work on earth, and you would find it difficult to force it to change orientation.

[Article on how they work electronically](https://www.livescience.com/40102-accelerometers.html#:~:text=An%20accelerometer%20is%20an%20electromechanical,or%20speed%20divided%20by%20time.)

[Video on how they work and are made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZVgKu6v808). The first half is probably what you're interested in.

From the article:

>dynamic accelerometer measures gravitational pull to determine the angle at which a device is tilted with respect to the Earth. By sensing the amount of acceleration, users analyze how the device is moving.

The basic accelerometer only measures along a single axis (forwards and backwards), but two or three of these can be combined for 2D and 3D sensing. Phones use 3D accelerometers because it's a marginal cost difference from 1D and 2D but allows for many more features and app compatibilities.

On Earth, whichever axis is oriented vertically will read the force of gravity as +/- 1 G (as seen in video animation). That direction must be ""down"".

In orbit where a person or object would experience zero G, all three axes would read 0, and the device would not know which direction is ""down"", and would not rotate itself based on its orientation.

You could possibly ""fake"" it by imparting an acceleration on the phone (by moving it or spinning yourself around), but I have suspicions that this would not be effective enough to make the device switch orientations. Accelerometers are very sensitive, so it would detect a change, but it may not be enough to convince the phone to change. 

From a design perspective, a device shouldn't ""overreact"" to minor acceleration changes like movements because it would be frustrating for users. Which is probably why when I spent a few minutes spinning around with my phone in different orientations it refused to rotate the screen. I couldn't impart a regular 1G of acceleration in any direction, so my phone wouldn't rotate the screen.

If we want to understand the code a bit better, we can turn the phone to landscape, and then set it flat on a table. Notice that it does not revert to portrait when flat. This tells me that it ""latches"" in place. It'll only change again if it's tilted back in the upwards direction. That means if you were to go up to space in portrait mode, there'd be no way to force it into landscape by tilting, and if you went up in landscape, it would similarly have trouble switching back to portrait (unless you force it there portrait-lock option). This is sort of a pain in the ass for frequent space-flyers.

Considering that 99.9999997% of smartphone users are currently not in space (a google search told me that there are 2.71B smartphone users, another told me there are 7 people in space right now, so I did the math), and there's probably no 5G reception up there either, it makes sense that smartphone manufacturers would design for users in a 1G environment rather than 0G.

Some hard drives (particularly in laptops) use an accelerometer for free-fall detection. It detects that momentary apparent weightlessness of a free-fall, and stops the drive from performing read/write actions. The disk is spinning at extreme speeds with the head extremely close to the disk. [This forum post](https://superuser.com/questions/474609/are-there-any-disadvantages-of-having-a-free-fall-sensor-on-a-hard-disk-drive) describes it as a jumbo jet flying a few feet off the ground. A hard impact during a read/write can destroy the drive.

The same forum post also claims that free-fall detectors in a hard drive have ruined an experiment in zero G before due to disabling itself (not necessarily on a space station, but perhaps in a parabolic flight experiment). This would be further indication that accelerometers don't function well in zero G environments. I bet that NASA, ESA, etc. if bringing a hard drive to space use the ones without free-fall detection.",1

Off the top of my head there is the [West Freeway Church of Christ shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Freeway_Church_of_Christ_shooting) where only two people were killed before an armed firearms instructor shot and killed the attacker. Since there were only two victims this wouldn't be listed under a 'mass shooting' by most sources.

We had a Jamaican family friend who detested being called African-American. And of course, there are plenty of white people from South Africa who are Americans of African descent (as Americans think of it) who nevertheless aren’t African-Americans as the term is used. 

Anyways unlike the other nationality-American constructs, African-American is used to refer to race rather then origin.",1

""Some groups and people have expressed objections to its use, contending that its religious reference violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.These groups believe the phrase should be removed from currency and public property. In lawsuits, this argument has so far not overcome the interpretational doctrine of accommodationism, which allows government to endorse religious establishments as long as they are all treated equally.

4049,"It’s always a good idea to read a little bit about the study to really understand what the authors are saying

I don’t know specifically what study you are referring to, but I found one from the National Center for Education Statistics that has very similar findings to what you quoted.  Link is at the bottom.

Just reading through the summary, two things really stood out.

First,  “adults who were unable to participate are categorized as having low English literacy skills, as is done in international reports (OECD 2013), although no direct assessment of their skills is available.”

Of the 21% of those deemed illiterate, about 18% of those (or 4% of the total study) were unable to participate, so they were deemed illiterate even though the authors admit there was “no direct assessment of their skills”.

Perhaps this is standard practice in the field, but assuming that lack of participation equals illiterate seems like a big stretch to me.

Secondly, “non-U.S.-born adults comprise 34 percent of the population with low literacy skills, compared to 15 percent of the total population”.

A third of those deemed illiterate are not US born and presumably learning English as a second language, perhaps in adulthood.

Assuming no overlap between those two categories, over half (about 52%) of those deemed illiterate were either born outside of the US or simply didn't participate in the study.

Just reading a bit about the study, I think that this is at least partly the case of the headline being a bit misleading.  Or at the least, a case of it meaning one thing for those familiar with this area of study and another thing for those that are not.

If we weren't so divided by colors and all this other crap we'd realize that its really only one race which is the human race. We all look diffrent due to being from diffrent enviroments and apart of the world but we are same race. If you take a certain animal and have it breed on the opposite side of the world its originally from, the generations to come are most likely going to change to adapt to the new enviroment. The fur may change color, get thicker or thinner etc. It's still the same animal just diffrent. But people (on all sides) are divided because in the world we live in right now everyone wants to be better than the other.

Way way back during the hunter gatherer days, it wasn’t uncommon for separate  human groups to fight over territory, food, etc. they would often even take members of the other group as prisoners. In order to survive, these abductees would develop what we now know to be Stockholm syndrome. The less resistant they were to their new group, the more likely they’d survive. Dogs and other pets don’t develop this because they didn’t evolve to. In fact many animals, especially dogs, have evolved alongside humans. So for that reason they actually survive better when their living in a home with humans.

If this *is* from a food distribution employee who is either mentally unwell or sadistic by creeping out the masses, then I've been able to roughly triangulate where they would come from (spanning from Cumberland County to West, Lycoming County to North and Carbon County to East). West Virginia and Maryland were also mentioned. For these reasons, I believe the person(s) doing this is from the Hershey area, either from Feeser's Food Distributors or from Dutch Valley Food Distributors. Considering the distance covered, I believe they could be a driver or somebody who works for a driver. Let me know if anyone has any other info or is interested in any other questions!",1

People have confused Love with Lust, so attractiveness is paramount.

Guys don't love the hot ones either. Typically, we use them to make ourselves feel better about ourselves. We're a bit too dumb to recognize that, so we'll never admit it, but that's the truth behind the curtain.

That's what you're missing out on, being used.

Learn to absolutely love yourself. You'll be spending an awful lot of time with yourself, you might as well make it enjoyable. Build a life that is yours outside of a relationship, so that when an opportunity comes along you know exactly what you're sacrificing to be with him.

Schools are more about rote memorization and don’t take into account how kids actually learn. Kids should be outside, running around, with the ability to figure things out on their own with a grown up mildly directing and there to prevent catastrophe.

Like most of the world, things aren't as stable as we would like RN. The cost of living is extremely high, even where it shouldn't be. Our schools and medical facilities are bad and seem to be getting worse. 

Also, for a country with free speech, you really have to watch what you say. While the government can't attack you for your speech, schools, corporate environments, and even home owners accociations or co-ops are mired in identity politics. You can lose a lot for saying the wrong thing, and those goal posts are always moving.

Crime and drug abuse are growing issues.


There are good things, too, though.


The USA is tremendous, and different states can feel like different nations do in Europe. Which state you choose will vastly change your experience. From people to attitudes, laws, and even the biome/nature will be vastly different from place to place. 

It takes more than 3 days, only stopping for gas to drive from east to west, and more than 24 hours from north to south. We have great roads, beautiful national parks, and just road tripping around can be an amazing experience.

The US is extremely diverse, and in most large cities, you can find a bit of home through dining and organized cultural communities.

If you're willing to work hard or are entrepreneurial, there is still a lot of opportunity to be had, and money to be made.

Most Americans are friendly people. Many people visiting the US that I speak to have the notion that it will be a violent place or that we are all shooting at each other constantly. This is surprisingly rarely the case, regardless of how our news looks. Again, the US is a massive place, and distilling down all the evil into a concentrated news cycle looks a lot worse than it is.

And some people don't hate, just dislike and get annoyed/irritated.

But for those who hate, it may be because of how he handled the coronavirus issue.

At first, he denied it. It was on the news that time, and on social media. 

Then, reports started rolling in about widespread infections in the country. But, he was slow to move. Countries like China(the literal epicentre of the pandemic) and South Korea were quick to move and try to stop it. For example, quarantining an entire area, like can't even travel by train outside that kind in the case of China. And this happened really quickly, so much so that China was praised for it's quick response in disaster control even when they were right smack in the  middle of the chaos.

And as a note, the US is by no means a poor country. In fact, resources available to it in terms of hospitals and finances and manpower are quite high. But response times were so slow that you had reported cases rising drastically by the day.

Not to mention the prank tweets he did which got some people harmed when they followed them. Might be partly their fault but when your country is one of the worst performers you don't want to lose their trust and think you're not taking this seriously.

He started to hoist blame on others, and say that he took it seriously from the start and all that when things got really serious. The news and social media picked up on that.

Not to mention the lack of support from the government at the local level in terms of crucial ventillators, where states were actually competing for them. Of course, due to the lack of preparations beforehand.


Might seem that he's a disappointing president, but to some, their grandparents died because of his carelessness. For some, their friends died because of him. 

This is made worse by the fact that he's a billionare. Someone who seems so far away and doesn't seem to care about them. Average people are more closely connected and relatable to average people than billionares are. Trying to explain away his mistakes may be to some as due to negligence instead of ""everybody makes mistakes"". ""He should've have helped us"" ""He's still playing around"" ""He got all this money and didn't spend a cent on us"" etc.

And, his mistakes were also present in earlier cases, such as the US-China trade war.

His character now seems to many as lousy and terrible and selfish. After all he has done, and all they have lost and suffered, some may choose to hate him. Especially with his big promises during his campaigns.


For many, he's a joke of a president. For some, he's an enemy.

If your son has not had his biological dad in his life for years now, he is used to not seeing him or knowing him.   You could tell him now, and he may not care or comprehend.  He may care more when he gets older and that may be a better time to tell him since it will be more relevant and he'll be older and able to understand it.

Assuming your son is 6 years of age, and he doesn't have any real feelings or knowledge of his first dad, you might be in the clear in telling him now.  I wouldn't say it was suicide, but you could say he passed away.

I would wait until your son brings him up ""Where is my first dad / can I go see him"" and then you break it gently to him that he is no longer living.  You can withhold information and it's not lying; you don't have to say it was suicide.  You will have to get creative here but really, only you know best - you're his mom!",1

4358,"It would depend on how big the ring was, and where on Earth you are standing.

At the equator, a ring would be a thin line in the sky directly overhead; if the ring was too thin you might not be able to make it out at all, but if it was larger you'd be able to see a thin, gray strip crossing the sky.

As you moved closer to the poles, it would be easier to see planetary rings, they would be a greyish strip in an arc in the northern or southern half of the sky (the opposite of whichever hemisphere you're currently standing on).  The thicker the ring, the more clear it would be.

A planet the size of Earth that did have a ring would likely have a very small, thin ring that would be extremely hard to see, and it would go away after a few hundred thousand years or so due to gravity pulling it into the atmosphere.  Our planet just isn't big enough to have an impressive ring system like Saturn's.",1
4359,"Hey man this is a great and serious question for sure. I’ll give you my perspective. 
I am a pastors son, grew up with a great family who raised me right with very high moral standards and ideals, especially in regards to sexual purity.... but I’ve always struggled with accepting it for myself (that’s a quick sniper of another long another story for another time).
 
I always felt the same way, that I was not ever going to have sex before marriage... but when I was 17 I began dating a girl who didn’t share the same ideals and had a totally different concept of sex and marriage. She didn’t hold sex as an act to the same standards: it wasn’t a serious moral decision to her. The really rubbed off on my (no pun intended idontthink) and next thing I knew, we crossed all four bases, and I was no longer a virgin. 

Afterwards , I felt like I had  to keep it a secret to my family. My dad would kill me and my mom would be disappointed and sad for me. I’ve committed adultery- an intense sin... but at the same time the desire and love that came from it never seemed bad to me?

But we broke up and she ditched me and afterwards I felt like it was all for nothing. I had extreme guilt, both Bc I did that and lost it to someone who wasn’t going to be my wife, but also because I tasted what it actually felt like, and desired to do it again. 

I think what I’m trying to say is, it’s about whether you can be honest to yourself about what you really desire, and your family and friends opinions and personal life really does dictate part of that. If you feel like you will regret your decision, remember that you can never go back and change it once you’ve done it. I have now had sex with multiple girls and am more accepting and comfortable with my actions... but at the same time , in the back of my mind there is still the guilt and shame that comes with my upbringing: what if I’m a sinner? What if I’m judged by it? 

Just be honest with yourself. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be chaste. The fact that you’re not even religious and still have doubts makes me think that you maybe should wait, but if it’s the right person, then perhaps not....

Hopefully that wasn’t all bullshit to you. Hope you figure it out and my heart goes out to you",1

4388,"Your daughter I would have a serious talk with. That’s not okay at all. Your daughter is almost an adult and she’s dating someone who isn’t even a teenager yet. Seriously, this kid is in middle school/7th or 8th grade, and your daughter is… a sophomore? A junior? Ridiculous. I encourage you to have a talk with your daughter about this and prevent it from happening. 

Your son… it’s a bit more complicated. I still wouldn’t allow it just because 14 and 16 are such different ages, but it’s not nearly as bad as 12 and 16. I don’t think it’s necessarily ‘pedo’ behavior, but it’s not the most appropriate thing either. I think you should have a talk with him anyway, but again, it’s not the worst thing that could happen.

ETA: I read some of your other comments. You don’t necessarily even have to do anything for kids to end up this way. I think the most important thing you could do in regards to your daughter is ask her why she thinks it’s appropriate to date a 12 year old, what her goals are from that relationship. I hope it’s nothing sexual, but honestly a romantic relationship isn’t appropriate here either. I’m not going to sit here and say your daughter is a sexual predator, but their relationship really isn’t appropriate. There is a common misconception that women cannot be predators; she may believe that she’s doing nothing wrong (again, I’m not saying she is a predator, but this is very inappropriate behavior), and perhaps it would be best to ask her what if the genders were switched? Would a sixteen year old boy (who can probably drive) dating a twelve year old girl (who may still play with toys) be appropriate?",1

What value do other people's opinions bring to your life?

That's a bad question, bad me, what I mean is, whose opinion matters, why does it matter, and what influence does it have on you?

I actually extract *all* of my value from other people. To such a degree that a breakup or the end of a important relationship makes me worthless to the point of suicidal ideation.

I literally have no sense of self, I am committed to being whatever makes other people happy.

This is very detrimental, how much do you identify with that?

How high and how low does a person have the ability to make you feel?

How much power do they actually have?

Who are you and when do you find yourself sacrificing who you are to make others happy?

Think about all of that, come up with some answers, even if they're temporary.

Think about who you are again, and the person you want to be.

Then ask if those people with power deserve to have that power.

Those that do should only be your absolute closest of friends. People you trust, that you can rely on. There aren't many.

Give yourself permission to sacrifice something for those people, what you consider fair, but create a point where you'll bend no further. Decide which parts of yourself are non-negotiable and defend it with everything you have.

Value yourself for the person that you are. Require nobody else's opinion to determine who you are, what makes you happy, what you enjoy, etc. 

Love the person that you are and defend that person like you would your best-friend. Don't put up with people disrespecting you, putting you in positions you don't want to be in, or who go out of their way to make your life more difficult. Don't give crummy people the power of relevance.

I understand we want to wear things that makes us comfortable, if we feel comfortable with boobs out then we should have the right to but save that for at home, or a night out or just a casual day.
If you’re a nurse or a doctor you have to wear scrubs, you’re not going to have your ass or boobs out. If you’re a chef you have to wear a chef coat, why? To keep you from burning yourself from the steam. 
You can be professional and still dress revealing however companies do have a set of standards to help provide guidance to their employees on what’s appropriate to wear. Dress codes can range from formal, to business, business casual or plain casual, just depends. 
Even though you like to be revealing, you can still dress sexy without being too revealing. Sometimes showing off your collarbones even a little shoulder is far more sexy than boobs (I even love boobs and have some pretty big knockers myself)  

I don’t think it’s because people judge (even though some really do) you just want to set an image regarding the image the company wants.

4612,"This is the closest to anyone ever describing something that sounds similar to what I feel sometimes too. It’s the same zooming and expanding, compressing and shrinking thing. Mine happens in daydreams though, it’s never been when I’m asleep. It’ll usually be better objects or my hands, in my mind they will become impossibly skinny one moment, and then morph into swollen balloons the next. And it has a sensation that comes with it. Sometimes it bothers me, sometimes I’m okay with it. 

I used to be fascinated by it because I could feel that it was something that came from my childhood. Something about pumpkins. Plushie pumpkins fills with little while beads. I know that sounds completely random but it’s all I have to go on. Something about the sensation I get draws my mind back to having those plushies as a child. I used to be very determined to figure out the connection, every time it would happen I would try to work on it a little hoping that some day I would understand. But I’ve given up because it seems hopeless after so many years. 

It’s never done anything to my vision, maybe my hearing though. I think I hear something when it’s happening and I can’t concentrate on anything else.

He told everyone this story, but most people would just blow him off when he told them. But we have the baseball bat as proof, and my grandma was there to witness it as well. When we finally asked them (separately of course) they told the story *exactly* the same

So when he was younger he was coming home late one night after a date with my grandma. He pulls into the driveway of their house and notices some sort of strange light about his garage. He said it was green lights in a circle pattern. Him and my grandma both stopped and watched it for a few seconds and realized it was getting closer to them. Now my grandpa was never a level headed man. So instead of getting in the house or getting in the car to leave, he ran into the shop (the one with the weird green lights above it) and grabbed his baseball bat. He said whatever this thing was, it got so close he could eventually see that it was smooth and metallic, and had probably a dozen green lights around the whole base. So he takes his baseball bat and just chucks it at this thing. He heard it smack the bottom of the UFO and then land on top of the garage. This UFO just took off after. He said the damn thing was faster than any airplane he had ever seen. When he went to get the bat the next morning, it was splintered and had a couple chunks taken out of it. He always kept that bat as a reminder that we are definitely not alone out here",1

Freeze indicates that the ever expanding universe will eventually get too spaced out for new stars to form until black holes are all that's left, eventually burning out from Hawking radiation or whatever. The Big Rip is similar, however in the infinite vacuum that is empty space at the end of the expansion mentioned in the Freeze, the possibility of a ""false vacuum"" breaking into a lower energy state that sends macro-physics out the window and having quantum physics as the new standard. a new universe could then be possible through random quantum fluctuations/quantum tunneling, giving the slim possibility of a new Big Bang (or something similar).

I have irl school so that’s my only motivator and I’m currently starting to work two jobs, so I understand how you’re feeling, as when I was in online school I didn’t do anything for my classes. First, you need to divide your work into smaller chunks and communicate with your teachers. Most teachers have been pretty lenient towards our online students so I hope that’s the same for you. Get a due date for all of your stuff and do the stuff that is worth the most points first, so you at least pass your classes.

Put your phone in the other room and start on your assignments. It may help to talk to someone while you work, or listen to music, but it could also distract you, whatever works best as long as you remove your distractors.

Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up quite so much so I’m going to add a few things. First off, castration can include the wang too. “The term castration may also be sometimes used to refer to emasculation where both the testicles and the penis are removed together. In some cultures, and in some translations, no distinction is made between the two.” ~ from the wiki page on castration. 

Secondly, a lot of comments asking about barbaric, draconian, corporal punishments. Practices of a civilized society and so forth. Frankly, if rape is commonplace enough to require these measures then the society has failed in its duty to its people and requires harsher penalties. My contribution would be to bring back the public aspect of this. Televise this shit. Associate public shaming with the crime and the next time a rapist considers assaulting someone they just might hesitate if they’re able to visualize the consequences. Is it civilized? No, but perhaps it would be a step back on the path to civility.

Video games can be a nice way to pass time, because they give you challenges and also rewards while looking nice.

For starters, since you seem to be adept with a normal laptop, I would recommend you to get some games on there.

A very well known program for getting games is called ""Steam"", which has a logo of an old steam piston. Here, you can get yourself all the games you like, from any genre you like and either free or purchasable.

There's very big differences in games regarding the power that's needed to run them, and some might be a little too much for your laptop. Ask your grandson to explain to you how to figure out how to tell if your laptop can run a game from the ""system requirements"" each of them comes with.

What you want to play is up to you! There's loads of categories to choose from, and you might want to explore those until you find something you like. Most games have a little trailer to show what they look like and how they work, and reviews next to them and underneath to help you choose.

Although it's not available on Steam, I can personally imagine that you might like Minecraft and have possibly heard of it before. You can roam a world full of animals, plants but also some vicious monsters completely free and build whatever you like, from a little house in the prairie to a tower to the sky!

Anyways, it's nice to hear that you are open for new things. Have fun!",1

Deep ideological divisions, a population that is largely ignorant of the underlying Constitutional principles, the predominance of false ""facts"" and narratives, a plethora of insane conspiracy theories, a willingness on the part of many citizens to demonize anyone who disagrees with them, and (finally) the realization that our system of checks and balances is not sufficient to quell the darker tendencies that are emerging.

But if you have chosen the opposition side, for whatever reason, your position has to be either ""a few bad apples"" to ""no problem at all, just spoiled brat kids growing up to be thugs"" and you have to defend any police action, because admitting that a cop did something wrong at this point would start the process of tearing down your world view.

If the average American education is anything like mine, you won’t know a damn thing about finances and will have very little context for how you will pay off these loans when you are 18. You may as well give them the loans at 14 for how unprepared they will generally be. Recruiters and propaganda from the schools also push the idea that you have to go to college to be successful.

First, giving other countries money has the benefit of keeping them from turning to Russia or China for support. Thus, it benefits the US because it's essentially buying allies and ensuring that foreign powers have trouble trying to expand their hegemonic influence. This is also why China invests so heavily in African infrastructure.

Second, countries having USD means they are likely to use USD. While a lot of global finance is based off the Dollar, China has been trying to use digital currencies and other practices to increase the amount of trade denominated in RMB. Just look to how Iran was cut off from SWIFT during the nuclear deal to see how controlling these institutions can turn into real international leverage.

5020,"Most people only have a few issues they actually care about. Like Abortion, gun control, diversity, the economy or healthcare. They tend to vote for the party they think fits them best on one or two policies. They might not agree on the others but value their one or two reasons more then them.

The easiest one to see for this is probably abortion. Plenty of people that are ProLife don't give a shit about Trickle down or supply side economics. They might pick up those beliefs because pro life candidates do and they trust their opinion. But the main reason they vote Republican is they value life at conception and any vote for a democrat threatens that in their eyes.

You can do the same for the democratic party. Plenty of people support it's push for more accessible healthcare but don't like gun control proposals. Other might be pro-life but not as focused on that as they are economic reforms. Basically the average citizen picks key issues and either compromises, explains away, or adopts the other stances of the party that supports them.

Edit: In a vain attempt to cut down on that amount of similar replies I'm getting on this I'm going to share some common responses.

This has been described as single issue voting. Meaning people who only vote based on a single issue. I think that can boil down most what I'm saying. I think most people do make decisions on a few issues and then just agree to the rest. Someone pointed this out as Wedge Issues which I think is a wonderful term everyone should learn about.

However, this is just based on the people I talk to in the Midwest. Friends and Family, college educated and HS drop outs, retired and just entering the workforce, living comfortably and those below the poverty line. Completely personal experience and I'm by no means a political expert nor have a studied the hard stats.

I don't think this is the only reason people vote for Trump. He has a cult following and a big enough base. I think it does answer part of OPs question.

I'm not advocating for Pro-Life. I'm sorry you got such an anti Pro-Life boner you need to say something about how stupid it is anytime someone brings it up. I get it, it's stupid the government feels like it needs to regulate the issue. I get that term Pro-Life is hypocritical since after the baby is born most Pro-lifers don't give a fuck about it. I do understand that Roe v. Wade can't be overturned and it's mostly up to States how to handle that. However that doesn't stop a federal government from having a certain amount of over reach. A Republican controlled federal government isn't going to step in to stop a State from saying you can only get an abortion in the first two weeks of pregnancy. They are also going to elect judges to the Supreme Court that if this issue comes up they will ignore the entire point of Roe V Wade.

Contrary to what others have said, unless the rate of exploitation decreases drastically very soon we are likely to see major societal collapses within our lifetime. My friends and I talk about it and we’ve mostly come to the conclusion that the best we can do is enjoy our lives to the fullest and appreciate every moment to the best of our ability. One could argue that life should always be spent this way but now it’s put in better perspective than ever. 

My only advice is to allow yourself the escapism you need. Whether it’s sports, gaming, outdoor activities, or just spending times with friends and family, we all owe it to ourselves to appreciate life and the human experience.

Personally, viewing it as a mental disorder helped me cope. I couldn't understand my feelings and hated myself for them, and calling it a disorder is the only thing that brought some comfort.

Odds are, people who complain like that, don't see the underlying issues. Yes, maybe them being overweight doesn't *help*, but there's also bigger issues at play. Do they listen to their wives, do they show affection and love the  way the wife wants (i.e. love language). Do they do things to make themselves look attractive beyond the physical? People find people attractive when they're kind or helpful, funny, intelligent, etc. If all you do is drink beer, slap her ass, and watch sports, that's not going to turn her on even if you're physically attractive and fit.

5096,"I mean the more nuanced answer is because you're... right. Sorta. Let me explain. Trans people know perfectly fucking well what their biology is and that it's not identical to their cis counterparts.   That is **separate** from their gender. It is seen as bad because that ""biologically"" line is often dogmatically used by transphobes to *inextricably tie gender and sex together.*

It's also treated negatively because it's more or less a transphobic dogwhistle. Again, because biologically speaking the majority of trans people know their gender doesn't align with their sex, bringing up the ""biology"" side put trans people in a tricky position and effectively ""forces"" them to concede to that point. However the issue there is that to the majority of transphobes that is all they need to invalidate yours and everyone's identity.

This leaves trans people and their allies to avoid engaging in those conversations at all, outside of people they are comfortable with, because it is often just a trap used against them. Trans people know their bodies better than others do and they understand what issues they face as a result of those bodies. It also doesn't help that this whole ""biology argument"" is usually just a gateway to peddle more dangerous transphobic ideas or push laws meant to discriminate against trans people.",1

5099,"As in many things in America, it depends wildly on where you are.

As an ex-journalist, I had to deal with a lot of cops, and I found a lot of them, especially in small communities, to be fundamentally decent. However, the way that I kind of ended up was that though there are good individuals within the institution, as a whole, the institution is fundamentally flawed. In the way that it trains its people, in the way that it views violence, in a way that it views the communities it ostensibly protects.

That, and simple tribalism means that people who are, individually, good people, can still circle the wagons around harmful people who corrupt the institution as a whole.

One bad apple spoils the whole bunch, as it were. And in an institution that we place trust in to arbitrate justice and decide in some cases who lives and who dies, we must demand reach the highest possible standards.

Edit: disabling replies to this, as there are far too many to properly deal with. 

In response to common questions: 

• Yes, of course race and other minority statuses, as well as socioeconomic status, have to do with this. I am autistic and while that is mostly invisible, it still means I have to suppress a lot of natural behaviors and tendencies. Autistic people are often [harassed and/or abused by cops too](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-016-2958-3), and if I weren't white, my interactions with police would be even more frightening than they already are.

• Yes of course not all small-town police are good, and small towns can foster deep-rooted corruption. I'd argue it's even easier for it to take root than in large cities, and once it's in, it's hard to get out. One commenter talking about their experiences at BLM protests in different cities and how the police responded sums it up very well, and I can attest to similar experiences at BLM protests in one of the communities I covered. 

• By ""Circling the wagons,"" I am primarily referring to police unions and their habit of protecting bad actors and attempting to force people out for naming police who do harm others. 

• If you are commenting to tell me journalism bad, you're hilarious. You should take your routine to the comedy club. Please ask yourself why your favored politicians want you to not believe the people presenting evidence they are lying to you.

Jokes aside, if you come up with a good way to find trustworthy news tell the rest of us. Until then you are stuck doing what the rest of us does: Trying to consume a wide array of media, keep the bias' behind them in mind, and try to extrapolate what is actually going on from there.

Otherwise try to find independent organisations and stay as close as possible to the source of the information (e.g. scientist quite often actually try to give laymans explanations these days - which are often more interesting and more informative than the abstract that filters down into mainstream media).

On the practical side, it quite simply comes down to finding sources who you reasonably trust or whose bias you are at least aware of.

Personally I found the work of the so called ""Skeptics"" movement - a social movement dedicated to the promotion of science - quite valuable. Though at the edges of the movement there tends to be a good bit of scientism and elitism.

And to preserve your sanity, start collecting some guiding issues. We all can't know about everything, but beeing properly informed about a few important issues can often reveal a pattern in how information that is presented to you, is manipulated.

It's easy to get caught up in what other people think of you.  Rejection is tough, too.  I wouldn't recommend dating when your self-esteem is low - you'll attract the wrong kind of people and healthy people may be concerned about dating someone who has major insecurities. 

 Ultimately, you'll want your self worth to come from within.  Women are often attracted to confidence. 

You're the only you in the universe. You have incredible value as a human.  Don't be a slave to the dating game that says either you win big or you're a loser.  It's not true. 

Enjoy this precious gift of life - focus on the things that bring you joy, hanging out with friends, a new hobby.  Read about how to be more mentally healthy, get a therapist, invest in yourself.  Learn what it means to be a good person, volunteer to help others (perhaps you can volunteer to help elderly people or even victims of domestic violence).  

Some women, especially those who feel they have powerful advantages in dating, can be bitches because they get away with it.  They're insecure and they feel powerful being able to reject tons of guys. Don't play their game, avoid them.  It's important to remember that your bad experiences with particular women don't translate to the entire gender - not all women are bad, but not all of them are good too.  However as a whole, they can suffer disadvantages like domestic abuse, pay differences, etc. 

I guess what i mean is, you can be an ally for women in general to have equality, and you can still hold women accountable to have decent human behavior.   Deciding to not to pursue a relationship with you does not make a woman a bad person, but rejecting you in a callous disrespectful manner does.  Are you mad because you got rejected and that affects your self worth or are you mad because of how you got rejected?  Even the most beautiful, handsome talented people in the world have relationship troubles- you're not alone! 

Don't waste your time, your life, trying to obtain approval and acceptance at all costs.  Once you feel secure in your worth as a decent person, you'll attract the right kind of person. 

Maybe make friends with some positive older male role models and if you feel comfortable, share your concerns.  I think people often get into these rabbit holes and bad ideology when they are lonely and isolated.  Friendship is much safer than dating for your self-esteem.  If you are a good friend - loyal, reliable, interesting, thoughtful - you will be a good boyfriend to someone.  Work on being a good friend and having healthy boundaries. 

Best of luck and cheer up - lots of women feel rejected in the dating game as well, it's just online dating that is really skewed and can be toxic.",1

- Some countries have almost no diversity, I'm talking 95% one race or more. This effects how people think and how the government thinks.

- We are allowed to critique, disagree, and change the government. It's not always easy but we can do it.

I care about US issues and I want to fight and make things better for me, people like me, and everyone in this country. This is the country I was born in and I don't want to give up and abandon it. The US has rampant corruption, racism, classism, healthcare issues, and more.

But I still have hope. I have hope because throughout the entire history of this country people who look like me have been enslaved, murdered, and people have tried their best to erase us. But we're still here, we're always going to be here, and we get better with every year. I want everyone to get better with each year. I don't know how long it's going to take and exactly everything it's going to take to make the changes I want. But I truly believe that we can get to a better place and that we are getting better slowly. 

We shouldn't runaway from corruption and injustice. We have to stand up to it. If people refuse to care then we have to be the ones to care. If they are corrupt them we must become incorruptable.",1

5134,"I appreciate your honesty here and I would like to attempt to answer your question. I in no way condone this behavior, but to simply answer the question it comes down to moral cowardice and groupthink. He probably was intimidating to more than just you, so folks rationalize minding their business over being proactive in their approach to call out abuse taking place in front of them. Then when you lobbied the word back at him it was probably a domino effect of one person said something then 3, until you lost the crowd. Unfortunately, they probably felt ashamed for not helping you, so it made it easier for them to condemn you because in their minds they already disregarded you. 

I'm sorry you had this experience it seems like there was compounded issues on top of one another that is a lot of pressure. I don't think you calling him the N word means you're judging our whole race however I'm glad you acknowledge that it was wrong and shouldn't have been said. 

Moral of the explanation people are very cowardly and usually instead of making up for it. They disregard even further, case in point here.

Edit: im grateful for the awards. I'm glad a nuanced take was well received. Understanding these dynamics are very important. The 3 major elements are present here. The aggressor turned ""victim"", the victim turned ""aggressor"" and the often abysmal response of the crowd(society) if we all can dissect what went wrong here we can improve each position. How not to be the initial abuser, how to better respond when we get treated unjustly, and to be more courageous when we are apart of the crowd. Thanks again!",1

5180,"So googling and reading on the Birkenhead it seems like no one actually says the reason. There is a practical reason more than just morality:

The British navy found that during chaotic evacuations, especially during flooding, people would be pulling against each other to try to get ahead. Frequently men would pull over women and children creating delays from the pileups and overall hurt the chances of everyone. The idea then became that the smaller, weaker people should go first and then the stronger people (men at the time) would then go and if they pulled against each other or the hull they would have the strength that it might not create a huge pileup. 


Just imagine a flooding ship in the pitch black darkness. Everyone poring out into hallways desperately grabbing and pushing trying to get out. Women and children often were trampled and overwhelmingly casualties of sinking ships consisted mostly of women and children. The Birkenhead drill aimed to change that.

Edit: to everyone complaining about the at the time bit; yes the average male is stronger than the average female however in this day and age I would hope that we are intelligent enough to recognize that gender is a lot more complex than that and hormone levels play a huge component in someone’s physically. You can say all you want about the averages. My hope with that line is that today we are smart enough to tell strong people from weak people without resorting to having them drop their pants. Some women are stronger than some men. The average goes one way but we are humans we are all about those outliers.

Edit 2: for a modern practical example look up the MS Estonia

Edit 3: bomb threats are different. That evacuation is about not letting the potential bomber know you are evacuating so that they won’t be tempted to detonate early.

Edit 4: most disasters kill ten, hundreds, or very rarely thousands. In a population of tens of millions, thousands don’t matter. In modern populations of billions thousands are a rounding error. Disasters don’t affect population growth. You don’t need to save “breeders” because the deaths from any single disaster (with the exception of something like bhopal) can’t actually impact the growth of the population in any significant way.

Edit 5: if it wasn’t clear women and children grab and trample too in panic inducing situations. The difference was when a man grabbed another man they we less likely to both fall over creating a pile up and then you get the station nightclub. They weren’t trying to stop grabbing and pushing they were trying to stop people falling when grabbed.",1

5182,"The biggest problem is that someone has to be in charge to oversee things and make sure things are distributed properly (and also what “properly” means). People being people, those who get to power are the type who want to be in power, and often rig the system for the gain of themselves and those they care about. So you get some built in corruption. Of course, there is grift everywhere, but in a system where those on top closely manage distribution of resources it’s going to be worse. 

There are also problems of incentives to do beyond the bare minimum for people, or rather the lack of those incentives. It’s why socialist/communist policies can work on small scale communities where you need little innovation and know and care about your neighbors but don’t work as well on larger scale things like…countries.",1

Last year I was in a job I hate, making barely enough money, and I was living and working about an hour from my boyfriend. I felt inadequate at work, I felt that I was too far away to be a good girlfriend, and I spent almost any extra money on ""stress shopping"" for things I didn't need. My anxiety was through the roof, and for the first time in my life I dealt with insomnia (that shit SUCKS). I cried all the time. 

My work closed due to Covid during the initial shutdown and I took the opportunity to interview for jobs. I got two offers right away, one paying $10k more than I was making and one paying $17k more! I ended up taking the lower paying one to address the work-life balance issues I had in my last job. I LOVE my new job and feel so valued and fulfilled. I then moved in with my boyfriend in a BEAUTIFUL apartment. I'm not stress shopping so I've been able to save a decent amount of money. I got back into my leisure interests, started playing a new sport, started a book club, and honestly virtual socializing has been great for me as many of my friends live far. I feel that I've actually grown closer to them and got back in touch with friends that I've lost touch with.

5296,"In addition to what darkedgefan said here's more info.

The 2 bombings shortened the war by a year and a half.  The military had estimated the war would not have ended until late 1946.  

While it gets little attention, the US sub campaign had nearly completely stopped food from getting into Japan.  Parts of Japan was already losing people to famine.  Had the war gone on until the end of 1946, it's been estimated one million additional Japanese would have died from famine.

The estimated death toll in allied casualties for an invasion was huge.  The military minted so many purple hearts in anticipation of the invasion that it didn't have to have more printed until around the time of the Iraq war.

The Japanese had used about 2800 kamikaze attacks by the end of the war.  They had 5000 planes in reserve to fight an invasion.  Additionally, they had trained kamikaze scuba divers.  They would have been outfitted with an explosive Lance.  When a landing craft passed over them they would strike the craft with the lance killing themselves and destroying the boat.  There were also orders that if an invasion started, all POWs were to be killed to free up all resources to fight the invaders.

A lot of the atomic bomb critics will ignorantly say there was no need to drop the second bomb because Japan was about to surrender.  Here's something most people don't know.  After the first bomb there was an attempted coup against the emperor by the heads of the army because they were afraid he might allow a surrender.  It was only the second bombing that convinced their military leaders to give up the fight.  Before the second bomb was dropped, the Japanese did reach out to the USSR to be a broker in peace negotiations.  The Soviets never communicated the overture to the allies.  The Soviets had no intention of working as a broker for peace because they were looking to start a war against Japan in the summer of 1945, just a few months after the German surrender.  The Soviets were looking for pay back after the Japanese beat them in Russo-Japanese war from about 30 years earlier.

The Soviets had plans to invade the northern island of Hokkaido and the Kuril islands.  Had the war not ended when it did the cold war would have also included a divided Japan in addition to a divided Germany and Korea.",1
5297,"Sorry to say I have no answer for this, but this is a really good question. I’ve had families discuss how difficult it is to adopt children, the constant scrutiny and judgement from social workers, the feeling like they’re constantly on thin ice, how everything could be taken away from them in one fell swoop. It’s horrible. 

It’s also counterproductive to making the world a better place. There’s so many children out there that need a home and so many responsible people wanting to adopt. So what if they don’t make like 80k or whatever a year? That doesn’t mean they’re incapable of bringing home a child and taking care of them. Why are adopting agencies so strict? Shouldn’t they be happy that there is a great demand? It would be really weird for a couple or even a single parent to approach their agency if they had any intention of harming children.

5305,"As a fellow older person, I have some thoughts:

1- I believe most people will view whatever music they listened to around high school age through their mid-twenties to be their ""classic rock"".  The music that they will think of as the best period of music with the most personal meaning for them.  

2- As it has become much easier to produce music solo and on a much lower budget, it is now possible for almost anyone to record and distribute an album.  This means that what was once reserved for people with real talent and money making potential is now available to anyone with a computer.  This is great, but it does mean you're going to have to sort through a lot more material in general.

3- Relating to point 2, the way we buy music changed dramatically when streaming and downloading became the norm.  When you used to have to buy a CD/tape/record and there was only one good song, but you paid $15 you might think negatively about the artist overall.  However, if I like one Taylor Swift song, but overall don't enjoy her music, I didn't directly pay any money to listen to that song so I don't mind.  This means artists can achieve a relatively high level of exposure and success without having a catalogue of music that is good, you just need that one song.  Basically, you have a lot more ""one hit wonders"" than ever before.

4- It has become harder to find something you might enjoy unless you know how to look.  Streaming services and YouTube will push specific artists regardless of how they match your taste.  This isn't new, radio stations did this, but I've found it's much less likely I will discover a new artist I like while streaming than say, browsing music at a brick and mortar location when I was younger.

5- Music has indeed changed quite a bit.  The music we produce as a culture will always change in tone and substance as generations progress.  This is good and normal, but might mean the type of music you prefer is harder to find and there may be less artists creating content you enjoy.

TLDR: Music industry changes lead to marketing changes mixed with cultural changes lead to difficulty in finding music you enjoy.",1

If you are in a life position where you can get a dog, and you are willing to make that commitment, a German Shepherd will be your best friend.

Ideally, in a happy, functional household, the kids will have their physical and emotional needs taken care of because that was the responsibility the parent(s) took on when they made the choice to have a child. In turn, because that child is raised responsibly, they will care enough for their family to stand by them and help in any way they can as they get older. 

However, in a less than ideal family, it does not mean that a child MUST do these things simply because their parents did the bare minimum in raising them. It's a matter of expectation - just because YOU made the choice to have a child does not in turn mean that child is required to care for you. 

From what I've seen (growing up in Western culture), when a child had a happy upbringing, they continue to help care for their family willingly, because that is what family does. But when that had a poor upbringing, their families are more likely to demand that they help care for them, despite having not shown the same care when the child was young and needed it most. In the latter situation, the kid does not owe their family anything.",1

Identical twins are split from the same egg and were fertilised by one sperm. 

They likely have the same size penis as they are identical in basically every single way (besides things like fingerprints, DNA isn't exact, etc).

However, there are environmental factors which can have an affect and result in differences. For example, if one twin...developed an eating disorder during their teenage years, a lack of nutrition may stunt their growth. This can then result in a smaller penis than their twin. So lifestyle and environment can have an impact on their physical appearances and may result in changes.

But if they have the exact same lifestyle, then they likely have the same penis size.

...

Fraternal twins are not from the same egg, and are both fertilised by a different sperm. So there are two eggs and two sperms involved. The two eggs were ""accidently"" released at the same time, and they were both fertilised. 

This means that while they are twins...they won't look exactly the same. Just like how we don't look exactly like our siblings.

5389,"There are two types of characters when it comes to race: There are characters where race is a relevant aspect of the character, and there are characters where race isn’t a relevant aspect of the character.

Characters in the former category should only be changed if you are intentionally trying to do something interesting with the character and you’ve put a lot of thought into it. Characters that fall into the latter category can be played by anyone and it fundamentally doesn’t matter.

It so happens that, historically, the overwhelming majority of characters where the race wasn’t really a relevant factor happen to have been defaulted to white. Meanwhile, and somewhat consequently, most non-white characters were explicitly written as non-white and not as characters where race was a non-factor.

The end result is that the type of character who can and should be cast without much regard for the race of the actor has an overwhelming history of being portrayed as white and thus are more likely to be “changed” from white to something else in modern portrayals than the reverse simply because there are so few historical non-white characters who could be made white without significantly changing the character.",1

5403,"Everyone’s story is different! I had an abusive mom and my parents were divorced. My dad was in the picture but only had very partial custody of me and I saw him about once a month. 

One day I finally had a mark that I could show my teacher at school so she’d take me seriously if I told her what was happening at home. I was afraid if I didn’t have evidence I’d be causing a fuss and then get in worse trouble. Here’s how it went down for me. 

I, young child, show up to school with a mark on my face. I work up the courage to tell my teacher what happened during lunch. She pulls me aside after recess or whatever and has me come tell another adult alongside her. They talk amongst themselves and decide it’s urgent enough to call the police. The police come, take pictures of my marks, interview me and take notes about what happened for evidence in court. Then call my dad to come pick me up from school that day. My mom shows up to get me - cops are like, nah, not until this is cleared up. My dad takes me for the day but then eventually I have to go back to my moms because there hasn’t been a court case yet to prove anything.

My dad hires a lawyer to help fight for custody. His side of the family shells out ~10k+ in legal fees. I spend the next couple of months at my moms in hell, taking notes in a *very* secret journal about the bad things that happen. Now a days it’d be good to upload these entries to a private place online where she can’t ever see them (new gmail account with strong password & no backup email for example). 

I gather enough evidence in my journal for the lawyers to make a good case that my life is shit. CPS comes to ensure my dads home will be safer for me. They approve. I move out of my moms house and any future visits with her are supervised. She moves out of town. I barely talk to her anymore and she hasn’t improved much as a person. 

That’s my experience. I was very fortunate to have a family member that would fight hard for custody of me. You’ll need evidence. Good luck, you don’t deserve this shit. Go to college, it’ll be so worth it. It’s a guaranteed escape from your shit family life and it’ll prepare you for the real world where people aren’t all insane and abusive. 

Just remember- this isn’t your fault. *What you’re experiencing is real. Don’t let anyone try to tell you you’re overreacting/too sensitive.* 

If you can’t get out now, get out during college. Find friends with healthy families that can help nurture and support you. Exercise, eat fruits and veggies. Play and have fun while you’re still a kid, whenever you can. You’re going to be wiser and stronger from all this and you WILL get through this. 

Peace and love to you, sweet human.

5405,"It's not so much that people are ""satisfied"" with this - they clearly aren't - but that the electoral system doesn't allow for a multi-party system to establish itself long-term.

There are numerous reasons why third, fourth, fifth and sixth parties don't manage to accumulate significant power as they do in other developed countries. The most important of these reasons is the simple-majority based voting system.

Say you want to be voted into Congress (House of Representatives). This means you need to run for that office in your voting district. Now, let's imagine there are 5 candidates. One of these candidates receives 40% of the total vote, while his competitors all receive 15% each. This means candidate A has just been elected to Congress **despite the fact** that he never actually reached an absolute majority. 60% of his district wanted someone else.

This already problematic system gets further undermined by anti-democratic tactics such as gerrymandering and the influence of big money in politics. However, the simple-majority system is really a big issue.

Most European countries, by contrast, vote their representatives on a proportionate basis. For example in my country Switzerland, we have a list-system. It works like this: In every Canton (= state), every political party creates a list of candidates. Those lists usually consist of roughly 60 people, although most of them won't actually get elected. Now, let's assume the elections give us the following results: Party A = 30%, Party B = 25%, Party C = 15%, Party D = 15%, Party E = 10% and Party F = 5%. Let's assume the lower chamber of parliament (House of Representatives) consists of 400 seats total. This means Party A will receive 120 seats, Party B gets 100 seats, Party C and D both receive 60 seats, Party E gets 40 seats and Party F gets 20 seats. These seats are now allocated to all the different Cantons (states) according to how populated they are. For example in the US, Party A might give 30 of its 120 seats to California but only 5 to Vermont. In every state, the top candidates from the list are elected. This happens with every party. This kind of proportionate system does not only allow a multi-party system, it actually *encourages* a multi-party system. Thanks to the proportionate representation, small parties still get a pretty decent representation in parliament and they have the opportunity to fight for minority interests. In the US, by contrary, small parties get ignored and swallowed up by the two big ones. If you are a Green Party candidate, you have no chances of ever being elected President or even Congressman, despite the fact that a decent number of voters want you.",1

Edit: But there is one thing that I'd like to say.

I believe that life is not always worth living, and that's pretty obvious for most people. If your life consists of only working to delay the inevitable, where you lose the ability to enjoy life itself in the process then what's the point? It's obviously not worth living in this case.

This question always comes up when you need to make a change. You need to make your life worth living. You are the one living, creating your life. Do not fall into the deterministic attitude of passively watching things fall apart. You have the power to die when you want, and in how you want. Who you are when you go. If you are not who you should be, then I would say you still have time to become who you are, before letting it all go. 

This life is not worth anything unless you are doing something else with it. Unless something else is happening with you, that makes it worth it. It would be a terrible catastrophe for you to die on the earth before having made the journey that makes it worthwhile. 

The reason why it is not given to you automatically is because it is *your* journey. These are your barriers to break, obstacles to overcome, to become who you really are. If you look at this drive to suicide closely, you'll find that it is the same as the drive to change. To discard this life, and begin anew. It is not a drive towards cowardice. It is a calling for those who are brave.",1

I do think a lot of animals will be returned after this is over. BUT plenty will stay adopted, the returned animals will have gotten to live in a home instead of a kennel, AND the shelters will have been able to cut costs by not needing to feed/house/care for so many animals. This seems like a win honestly.",1
5410,"In general, sexual freedom has been tied to LGBT rights across several political movements. Especially during the AIDS crisis, when sexual health education was paramount, explicit discourse about sex became very common in LGBT protests and the inclusion of sexual themes became more common (obviously, its tame in comparison, but for example, kissing was a large part of marketing campaigns and protest as both a symbol of visible gayness and as a pushback to all of the dehumanizing and exclusion centered language and social treatment that people with AIDS faced-- the kissing protests were a way of saying ""we're here, we're queer, and touching people with this disease cant hurt you"" when most people still didn't understand how HIV spread and fear was rampant.)

But even earlier, in the Stonewall era, LGBTrights were tied explicitly to sexuality, both through sex work and sex clubs. Sex work was not an uncommon occupation for LGBT people, especially trans people who were largely excluded from standard jobs or those who had to leave hostile families because of their orientation. Additionally, sex clubs were some of the very few designated places for gay people to meet, socialize, find people to connect with, etc., especially in larger cities. Because of this, gay kink kink communities have always been at least tangentially connected to the LGBT movement in general, especially in places like New York and San Fransisco. 

So this accounts for some of historical reasons for the sexual openness often attached to Pride. But more simply, Pride has been and is often still considered a time to be shocking, to be the most brazen and public version of your orientation, and to fly in the face of the stifling conditions that society has held for LGBT people for all of our history. That leads to some serious letting down of the hair, to such an extent that some may see it as just acting out. And some people do just embrace a really out there sexual lifestyle. That's true of straight people as well, but straight peoples' orientations and sexual practices haven't been so directly tied to politics and protests, so you dont see such an organized display of kink attaching itself to any particular public events. 

I will say that this has not been my Pride experience. In recent years especially, there have been a lot of pushes to make Pride family friendly, at least during the general parades. Of course, its still a huge celebration, but I think most of the rowdiness is relegated to going out after Pride or to specific adults only events. People take their kids to the day activities, and I've never seen anything inappropriate, just some skimpy outfits that were by no means inherently sexual (usually costumes rather than kink gear.) Its becoming less sexual.",1
5411,"This is a really tricky question to answer neutrally.

The super short version is that after WWII, Britain created Israel as a refuge for Jewish people. Except it did so right on top of Palestine (which was a colony of Britain of the time, and was a traditionally Islamic region), then ditched and said 'good luck, not our problem'. Since then, there's been a lot of fighting and wars between the two groups. There's two peoples, one land (and not just one land, one with a whole ton of extremely important holy areas for both religions), and both 'valid' (in some sense) claims to the area. They both feel like they're defending themselves from outsiders.

In most recent times, Israel has had the upper hand (due in part to support from the West, especially the U.S.), and has controversially claimed certain areas as rightfully theirs. In some case removing Palestinians to move in Israeli's. The current party leading Israel is their hardliner party.

Both countries have a mix of opinions- there are hardline Israeli's who think the area is theirs(usually for an explicitly Jewish state) and don't want to compromise, and some moderates. And vice versa, Palestine has hardliners who don't want to compromise, and some moderates. The more blood that gets shed on both sides makes compromise more difficult.

In general the whole situation is kind of fucked and there's no easy solution that would make everyone happy, at this point.

edit:

One minor clarification, based on feedback: Judaism has a connection to the region from Old Testament times. The area has been under continuous conquered/converted/occupied (including Islamic) since then, but there's been a small existing population of Jewish people, just much much smaller than the post-WWII immigration population. So it's not that Britain randomly picked it from scratch in 1948- there's historical connections/build up, which is what i meant about valid claims/holy land; not just that Britain put Israel there.",1

5425,"If you're looking for a serious answer there is a marked difference in behaviour between the Old Testament God and the New Testament God. The OTG is the one that you hear about smiting cities and taking vengeance on sinners. Part of the point of Christianity is that Jesus sets up a new covenant, or understanding, between God and humanity. This might sound strange but you can think of the stories in the OT as being based on the stories of a primitive people. ""Why did the plague of locusts happen?"" ""Because God was angry."" 

Jesus came along and said that was incorrect thinking: God loves everyone unconditionally, even people who sin, and he doesn't go around destroying sinners. If people are destroyed it's because God has given us freedom to explore the consequences of our actions and therefore doesn't interfere in the world.

Think of it like a game: if you were playing a game and every time you were about to die someone stepped in and saved you, it probably wouldn't be a very interesting game and you wouldn't learn much since you are basically invincible. So God doesn't interfere directly in human affairs because it would take away the reason for existence and our ability to grow as individuals and as a people. But I digress.

tldr: the Old Testament God is the angry one who kills people, Jesus said that's not the way it is, God loves you and bad stuff happens because it has to for free will to exist.

Edit: a few people asking about why God allows bad things to happen. A response to /u/AustonStachewsWrist:

>So the all powerful dude didn't do it? Or we're just pretending he didn't do it? Or, he did it and he's learned not to do it going forward? 

I see what you're saying but I think the correct option is (1) God didn't do the bad things in the Old Testament, we just thought he did. Humans were primitive back then. Very few were literate or capable of the kinds of theological discussions we're having here. Back then, if the Sun rose, people wondered why and in the absence of science they just concluded that ""God did it"", just like the earthquakes and the floods and everything else. Jesus came along and said, ""God didn't do those things -- he loves you."" Then people might ask why God would let those bad things happen? 

This is harder to answer, but it's possibly due the fact that we grow as individuals by experiencing hardship and pain. That's a difficult pill to swallow, I know. Especially when you're in pain. I get it. I think it's a bit like the parent who needs to let the child make their own mistakes so that they can learn and grow and become happy. God does the same for us. Of course, people inflict horrific pain and suffering on others. When we look at the pain someone goes through we have to balance it against the other part of Jesus' message, which is that God will grant us all eternal life in paradise. Compared to that, what is a few years of pain on Earth? Especially if by experiencing pain we can become better people? There's an excellent quote by John Keats that sums things up:

I'm 27. I've had depression most of my life, and I have an autoimmune illness that keeps me in constant, but manageable, pain. I live alone, and I'm unemployed. I suck at maintaining friendships bc I just don't have the energy. (I have been going to therapy for the past 7 years, to get help. And my current therapist really helped.)

What I live for are the small pleasures of life. When I get a job, I'll be able to get a dog. I have saved money this year, so I bought a record player and a few vinyl records, because listening to music brings me joy. In winter I'll be able to buy ""marron glacé"" again (candied marrons? I couldn't find the translation). I want to eat a poke bowl from that one shop I love. I want to finish watching Supernatural. Someday I want to have a garden and grow my own vegetables. I want to see Vienna again.

To keep going, I make sure to have at least one more thing I want to do in the future. That's how I survived my early 20s : ""I can't kill myself today, tomorrow there's the new episode of Game of thrones/Supernatural/Sherlock/One Piece/whatever. I can wait until tomorrow.""

The neoliberal economists like Hayek gave ideological weight to the idea that government intervention, at least when done on behalf of the poor and middle classes of society, will inevitably lead to tyranny.

5457,"I'm black and was born and raised in the Netherlands. I grew up in a pretty mixed community so I never felt like I was any different from the other kids. Even though I was bullied, it was never because of my race. One thing you should know is that referring to people by race isn't as common here as in the US. Mostly you refer to people by ethnicity. I'm referred to as ""Antillean"" a lot more often than I have been referred to as ""black"". That's not to say that I haven't had my fair share of racist experiences, but they didn't really affect me that much. They never stopped me from achieving my goals.

As for systemic racism, I don't know. When I think of something ""systemic"" Apartheid or Jim Crow, or even redlining comes to mind because there is an actual ""system"" in place that reinforces racial discrimination. I also think belief in race and racial differences is a prerequisite to calling something racist. I feel like people refer to things as being racist too often while they are actually xenophobic.

I also don't think racism (or xenophobia for that matter) is a result of capitalism. Tribalism is an innate feature of human beings. Separating people into groups of ""us"" and ""them"" and claiming moral or intellectual superiority. What we now refer to as racism used to manifest as tribalism, nationalism, classism, etc, way before our contemporary capitalist society came to be.

It's not necessarily that ""white people"" have to educate themselves either, by the way. I've seen plenty of the same type of discrimination I've experienced directed to East Europeans for example.  The majority should just be considerate of the minority in any scenario.",1

5508,"Although we do feel like we learn a lot from social media, how much deep, comprehensive knowledge on any subject do we actually receive from it? Social media convinces us that we are learning a lot from it but in reality we are, for the most part, just filling our heads with an incomprehensible tangle of surface level ideas which would never really benefit us in reality.

Books, on the other hand, should excel in explaining the subject you are reading them for, as long as we assume it is a good book in the first place. They provide more in-depth content and allow for more meaningful discussion than the ill-informed ""hot takes"" that cloud the internet nowadays. You can argue that individual books only focus on specific things while the internet excels at giving you a wide variety of trivia about the world, but what's more useful, buckets upon buckets of random trivia that fills the mind or a deep understanding on those specific things you could just know eye-grabbing facts about? I'm not saying that all information one gets from the internet is worthless. There are tons of very informative websites that can teach you things you would have never been able to learn pre-internet just like how there are tons of books that wont. Those are great, I'm just talking about social media, like Reddit.

Moving past the idea that books usually will educate you better than the average dose of your social-media slushy, lets now talk about the artistic benefits of reading books rather than the more quantitative educational benefits.

Alongside music and art books have been one of the most dominant mediums for artistic expression throughout human history, and for very good reason. Books are like fertilizer for your mind and imagination because unlike movies or video games (which are artistic mediums in their own right) everything inside a book relies on your imagination to realize it. Alongside the imagination it influences, this allows books to have a higher tendency of being more ""vague"", or up to the readers interpretation, unlike movies or music or art which all necessitate their own amount of interpretation but to an arguably lesser extent.

But of course, not all books are that great. As with all mediums of thought there are good ones and bad ones. No one expects you to benefit from the complexities of a book like twilight just like how no one would find it worthwhile to study the plot of a transformers movie. At that point arguing that social media is preferable wouldn't be completely unfair, although I still think its healthy enough for the mind to be worth something.

I would struggle with certain things initially like bending to tie my shoes etc. I felt embarrassed myself and would try to put up with the pain or down play it and tried ignoring it when actually I needed to make adjustments to my life and get physio. 6 months later I broke my ankle and had to use crutches. People around me including strangers suddenly started to offer help, opening doors getting a second chair so I could elevate my leg etc. I was offered sympathy and understanding and asked how I was doing. As person who has suffered with mental health issues my whole life this really was an eye opening experience for me. I personally feel that if people cannot see what is wrong (like those with hidden physical disabilities) people assume your faking it, looking for attention or it's not as bad as your making it seem. Almost like if they can't see it they cannot empathise with another human in need.

5585,"Because Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Gender Dysphoria are two different diagnoses.  

From a medical perspective, the most important difference between the two is that, in one of them, the patients mental health improves by psychological means like realizing that they are delusional about their appearance whereas physical improvements don't actually help.  

In the other, people feel better about themselves by actually changing their body/social role whereas denying their gender-identity makes them feel worse.  

On top of that, one is a mental illness with psychological causes. Gender Dysphoria, however, is technically a mental illness. It is the stress felt by the brain when sexual attributes do not align with it's gender identity. However, the usual cause of that mental illness: someone's gender-identity not matching their sex assigned at birth is not considered a mental illness, it is a neurological/biological configuration of the brain.

Using drugs in sports only works when one side does it in secret. Otherwise everyone would use the same ones and the advantage would go away. There are health risks to a lot of the drugs and other cheats, and most are not at all tested for safety.

In beauty pageants it's really unclear what is even being measured. At one time they were mostly about physical appearance but pretty much all of them have at least tried to claim that the women are being judged for other qualities. So what does it even mean to have an equal playing field.

Also look at the different places of make-up vs. performance enhancing drugs in society at large. Make-up has been part of the normal kit for most women for decades. Performance enhancing drugs are not only banned in sports but are generally something we try to keep out of schools and amateur sports, again for health reasons.

5607,"This is a difficult question to answer, and I can only speak from my own experience as a transwoman. My dysphoria arose early in childhood. I only played with girls and could never understand why everyone would get upset when I played with dolls, babies, barbies, or whatever else. I was bullied relentlessly in my early years for 'sounding like a girl' and 'acting like a girl'. I was a smart kid, and I worked hard to act like a boy as much as possible. I had to think about how to act like a boy and tried to stop moving my hands so much, not talk in such a high pitch, etc. Every. Single. Day. I knew something was wrong with me, but because I never heard of this happening to anyone I told myself that I was crazy and wrong. I hated everything about myself. I was too girly to be boy but too much of a boy to be a girl. I was depressed, alone, and couldn't connect with anyone because I was petrified that if anyone found out I thought I was a girl I would be sent to the loonie bin. Eventually at 14 I had enough and I attempted suicide and was found by my mother in time to have my stomach pumped and promptly awoke in a psych ward. 

After I was released a week later I was exhausted with life and decided to do some research. I was tired of being miserable and wanted some answers. Up until this point I was terrified to research anything for fear of finding out I was truly alone. I stumbled upon the term transgender and read into it for weeks and I decided that I would transition as soon as I turned 18. I sat on that information for four years and at 18 I saw a psychiastrist specifically for my dysphoria. They diagnosed me with gender dysphoria and recommended I get on hormones immediately. I declined the prescription and got a second opinion, and then a third, and then a fourth. Every single one of them agreed that my best option would be to transition with the help of regulated hormones and therapy. I asked every single one of them if there was an alternative and they said no, other than antidepressants (which weren't doing shit for me). Of course, I already figured this was the case but I had to be absolutely sure. So, I finally began taking hormones and prepared to spend the rest of my life alone. I knew I would never be taken seriously, I knew I would never be loved again, I knew everyone would think I'm a freak and I knew all of my friends and family would be dissapointed or disgusted but I was suicidal, miserable and desperate. I just wanted to feel any level of happiness and comfort with myself, whatever it took. 

My choice was to live miserably and inevitably kill myself or to try for the one chance of happiness I had in front of me. I took the gamble and transitioned. 

Sorry for the long answer! This is a question I see often and I just wanted to provide as much insight as I could as to why someone makes this choice.

Being free to dream of whatever we want, believing that there is, indeed, good and bad (when we grow up, we discover that this is only a fairy tale thing) in life. Believing that we are, just for a moment, well... special. Being an adult sucks, nothing has any sort of sense, any sort of importance. It's all about surviving the most we can. Suddenly, being a rockstar, a football player, an actor, all of this dreams start to fade away. 

Well, I'm not saying that it's impossible to achieve any of those things I mentioned before. But being a kid, like... nothing has consequences, everything could be reached out.

It's not that it were only ""simple"" times, the thing is, those were the only times (for the majority of people) that we could dream and aspire for this things. When we could project ourselves living the story of a lifetime.

It's hard to describe, and I think that I didnt express myself that clear. But, well... I guess thats it.

Can you force yourself to be straight if you are gay? You can certainly modify your life to *appear* to be straight to the outside world, but that wouldn't change how you *feel*.

For me, that's what being trans feels like. I just knew something was different, and appearing as a girl felt viscerally wrong. My body felt wrong. Why? Who knows, maybe there's a neurological or genetic explanation, maybe not, but knowing doesn't change the fact of it. It's certainly not a decision based on stereotypes.

My pets rely on me for everything. It’s my responsibility to keep them fit and healthy. They cannot advocate for themselves even slightly. There is very little in place in society, comparatively to people, to protect them. So it falls to me to make sure they have a good life. I guess that makes me very protective of them. I love people too but animals are a form of companionship that is relatively uncomplicated and completely unconditional. 

Besides that, how you treat things you consider ‘lesser’ than yourself is often a big indicator of what kind of person you are.

The crisis has so far caused mass destruction of property and loss of life, with over 17 million hectares of land burned, 3,000 homes destroyed, and 33 lives lost. The cause of the bushfires are due to a combination of the dry climate caused by climate change, high temperatures, and strong winds. The crisis has been exacerbated by the mismanagement of the forests and the lack of controlled burning, which has allowed the fires to spread rapidly.

In response to the crisis, the Australian government has declared a state of emergency and has committed over $1 billion to relief efforts. The government has also implemented a number of measures to help those affected, including providing emergency relief payments, increasing access to mental health services, and providing assistance to volunteer firefighters. Additionally, the government has also established a National Bushfire Recovery Agency to coordinate the national response and provide long-term support to affected communities.

The bushfire crisis has had a devastating impact on the environment, with estimates of over 1 billion animals affected. In response, the Australian government has announced a $50 million recovery fund to help protect and restore habitats and species affected by the fires. Additionally, the government has committed to a $2 billion package to help regenerate and restore the affected areas.

The Australian bushfire crisis is an ongoing event and will require the continued support of the government and the public to ensure the recovery of affected communities and the environment.",0

They are beings of immense power and ancient knowledge that are capable of manipulating and manipulating reality itself.

He may be able to make observations from a detached, analytical perspective, but he will often miss the subtle nuances of social interaction and human relationships.",0
937,"The difference that this would make for Clark Kent, Superman, and the world would be immense. For starters, Clark Kent would have grown up in a much different environment than Smallville, Kansas. He would have had different experiences, different relationships, and a different understanding of the world. He may have developed differently, and his values and beliefs could have been shaped differently.

As for Superman, the location of his landing would have had a major impact on his mission and purpose. He may have been more focused on protecting Australia and the surrounding countries, rather than the United States. He could have had different enemies, different allies, and different challenges that he faced.

Finally, the world may have been a very different place if Superman had landed in Australia instead of Smallville, Kansas. His presence and actions could have had a very different effect on the global balance of power, and the course of history could have changed dramatically depending on his decisions and actions.",0

It is likely that alien races have different cultures and beliefs than humans, and therefore, may not believe in the same concepts of magic and wizardry. It is also possible that they may not have the same access to resources that humans have, such as books and training materials, and therefore may not have the same capabilities. Additionally, some alien races may not have the same level of technological advancement as humans, and therefore may lack the tools and knowledge necessary to create powerful wizards.",0

Additionally, they wanted to make sure that he would not be corrupted by the dark side, so they kept a close eye on him and limited his access to things like powerful artifacts and teachings.",0
951,"The long-term impacts of this vigilante's actions will depend on the region in question, as well as the degree to which the camps had been established in the area. If the camps had been established for a long time, then the impacts of their removal could be significant.

For example, if the camps had been providing a steady source of income to the local economy, their removal could lead to a decrease in economic activity. It could also lead to increased crime in the area, as the camps were often a source of illegal activities such as smuggling and banditry.

On the other hand, if the camps had been relatively new and were not providing significant economic benefits, then their removal may have little long-term impact on the region.

When the person is rematerialized, the pattern buffer must recreate the person from the pattern. If the pattern is not exact, the rematerialization process could result in the person being significantly different from their original form, or not rematerializing at all. In addition, the person may not be able to survive the process of being rematerialized if their body has undergone major changes since the original scan was taken.",0

The Hutts have been involved in the underworld since the earliest days of the Galactic Republic, and their influence has only grown over time.

Secondly, the Hutts are incredibly powerful and influential. They have large, powerful networks of crime syndicates, and they are incredibly wealthy and have access to vast amounts of resources. This gives them a great deal of leverage when it comes to dealing with other criminal organizations.

Finally, the Hutts are incredibly shrewd and cunning. They are experts at negotiating and manipulating, and they know how to get what they want. They are also not afraid to resort to violence if necessary. Their ruthlessness and willingness to use any means necessary to achieve their goals has made them incredibly successful in the criminal underworld.",0

1020,"If Palpatine had been discovered to be Force-sensitive as an infant and been given to the Jedi Order, his life would have been vastly different. He would have gone through the training of a Jedi, learning the ways of the Force, and of the light side of the Force. He may have even been a powerful and respected Jedi, and potentially have even achieved the rank of a Jedi Master. However, as he was inherently ambitious and power-hungry, he may have still become disillusioned with the Jedi Order and its strict adherence to the light side of the Force. It is possible that he may have still gone down a darker path, but his journey may have been different, as his understanding of the Force would have been more complete.",0

The next few days were a blur of news reports, speculation, and fear. We all just wanted to know what was going on and if there was anything we could do to help. We heard stories of people trying to find ways to reverse the Snap, but it seemed impossible. We were all so scared and powerless.

Eventually, the Avengers were able to undo the Snap and bring everyone back. I remember the sense of relief that came over everyone when it happened. We all felt like we could breathe again.

1035,"Elves are often depicted as being powerful in many fantasy settings, but their numbers are usually very small. This is likely due to a combination of factors. Firstly, elves tend to be very long-lived, but have low birth rates. This means that the population does not grow quickly enough to replace those who die. Secondly, many fantasy settings have elves living in isolated communities, making it difficult for them to interact with other races and form alliances. Finally, in many settings elves are often persecuted by other races, leading to conflict and further population decline.",0

1051,"There are a few reasons why we often see reanimated zombies with bites or missing limbs in zombie films. One is that it is much easier to create a believable effect and a sense of dread when the zombie is still recognizable as a human. For example, a zombie with a missing limb is more immediately recognizable as a zombie than one with no limbs at all. Another reason is that it is easier to create suspense and tension when the zombie can still move and attack. Lastly, it is part of the horror genre trope of having the zombie be a physical embodiment of the fear and dread of death.",0

In some cases, the truth is not so clear-cut and requires more evidence and testimony. Furthermore, truth potions are expensive and not always available, so they cannot be used to solve every case. Finally, even if a truth potion is used, it is still up to the judge or jury to decide if the accused is guilty or not.",0

1200,"The concept of slavery in the Star Wars prequels is complicated and controversial. While the droids are indeed capable of performing many tasks, they lack the capacity for independent thought and decision-making, making them unsuitable for some of the more complex tasks that require a human touch. Additionally, the droids are owned by corporations, meaning that the droids are not truly “free” but rather are owned by their masters. Finally, the droids are seen as disposable and expendable, making them a convenient and affordable labor source. Ultimately, slavery in the Star Wars prequels is a reflection of the political and economic realities of the time, and is indicative of the power imbalance between the wealthy and the poor.",0

It was meant to be a physical barrier to provide a measure of protection from the Kaiju, and it was hoped that the wall would be able to buy more time for the Jaeger program to find a way to defeat the Kaiju. However, the wall was not designed to withstand a full-on attack from the Kaiju, and it quickly became clear that it would not be enough to keep the Kaiju out.",0

As for why they aren't in prison for breaking and entering, it's because they usually have permission from the owners of the buildings they investigate. They also often have a good reason for entering the buildings, such as they suspect the building is haunted or they suspect a crime is being committed. Because they are not professionals, they do not break into the buildings with malicious intent.",0

The Moon Spirit would have assisted Aang in defending the Northern Water Tribe by providing him with spiritual guidance and power. The Moon Spirit was also able to create a powerful barrier around the tribe, which would have been invaluable in defending against the Fire Nation's attack.

The public is also more aware of the potential for advanced technology, and this has led to a greater acceptance of technological advancement, as well as a greater demand for new products and services that are designed to help protect against these threats. This has also led to a greater demand for government regulation and oversight of these technologies, as well as a greater impetus for research and development in this area.

1644,"It is often the case that advanced civilizations in fiction have a tendency to revert to using melee weapons, such as swords, spears, and other primitive weapons. This is usually done for a variety of reasons, including symbolism, tradition, and practicality.

Symbolically, weapons such as swords and spears are often associated with strength, honor, and courage, and are often used to represent a character’s power or status. For example, in the Dune novels, the sword is a symbol of power for the ruling families, and is often used as a sign of respect and allegiance. Similarly, in Asgard, Thor’s hammer is a symbol of his power and strength, and is used to demonstrate his authority.

Traditionally, many cultures have long histories of using melee weapons in combat, and this tradition often carries over into the fiction. In Wakanda, for example, the use of spears and shields is a long-standing tradition, and is seen as a sign of strength, courage, and honor.

Finally, melee weapons can often be more practical than advanced weapons. In many cases, they are easier to use, more reliable, and require less maintenance.

Additionally, it can be used to locate a person or object, as seen when Harry Potter used his Patronus to find the Sword of Gryffindor.

They could use all four of their arms to deliver more powerful and varied attacks, as well as defend against and counter multiple opponents more effectively than most humans could. Their martial arts would also include a greater emphasis on throws and joint locks, as well as more elaborate techniques for use against multiple opponents. It would also be likely that they would have developed techniques and strategies that take advantage of their additional limbs, such as using two arms to grapple an opponent while the other two deliver strikes or blocks.",0

1683,There are a few possible explanations as to why Gilderoy Lockhart was not discovered as a fake before getting a job at Hogwarts. One is that he may have used complex magical charms and enchantments to make himself appear more experienced and knowledgeable than he actually was. Another possibility is that he used his charisma and charm to deceive those around him. It is also possible that he was hired by Hogwarts due to a shortage of qualified teachers at the time and they simply did not have the time or resources to do a thorough background check.,0
1684,This would be a devastating revelation for Batman. He has always looked up to his father and believed him to be a symbol of justice and morality.

2. Become a symbol of hope. You can use your superpowers to show people that there is still hope, even during a difficult time. You can do this by performing acts of kindness or by simply being a visible symbol of hope.

3. Help in other ways. You can use your powers to help in other ways, such as creating awareness about the virus, helping to coordinate relief efforts, or even helping to find a cure.

These are just a few ideas, but ultimately you will have to decide what is best for you and the people you are trying to help.",0

At the same time, The Batman's presence in the Marvel universe would bring a sense of justice and order to the world. His relentless pursuit of justice would clash with the chaos of The Joker's plans, and their conflict would be one that would be felt throughout the Marvel universe. The Batman's moral code would be a stark contrast to the often morally ambiguous actions of other Marvel characters, and this could cause tension among the other characters.

However, it is known that both Magneto and Xavier have discussed this topic with Reed Richards. In Fantastic Four vol. 1 #450 (July 2002), Xavier and Magneto discussed their respective children, Franklin and Wanda, and how they were able to manipulate reality in ways that neither of them could. Reed Richards offered advice on how to better understand and control their powers, and better protect their children from harm.",0

It is also a reflection of a Jedi’s personal style, philosophy, and beliefs. The two-handed style of lightsaber combat emphasizes power and control, which is something that a rapier or foil cannot provide. The lightsaber is also a versatile weapon, capable of both offense and defense, and is very effective against blasters and other energy weapons.",0

As a result, the inhabitants of those star systems may not be able to come up with original names for all the celestial bodies in it, since they may not have the necessary information to do so. Additionally, many star systems contain dozens, if not hundreds, of planets, moons, and other celestial bodies, making it difficult to assign each one a unique name.

For that reason, it might not make sense for wizards to use a strap to keep their wands close by.",0

The creatures are highly sensitive to sound, so the humans have had to adapt to a world of complete silence in order to survive. This means that the animals of the ecosystem have adapted to the silence as well, and are able to coexist with the creatures. Additionally, the creatures have likely caused some disruption to the food chain, as they feed on other animals. However, with the humans' help, the ecosystem is likely able to recover and remain balanced.",0

While it is true that the Avengers all fought Thanos one-on-one in Infinity War and were able to hold their own, the fight against Past Thanos was much more difficult. This is because the Avengers were not prepared for the fight against Past Thanos. They underestimated his strength and did not have a plan to take him down. In addition, the Avengers were already weakened from the fight against Thanos in Infinity War, and this made them even more vulnerable.

1827,"Entering hyperspace coordinates is important for a variety of reasons. First, it allows the ship to travel to specific destinations with greater accuracy and precision than randomly jumping. This means that the ship can travel to its intended destination faster and with greater efficiency.

Second, entering coordinates allows the ship to avoid certain hazards, such as stars or black holes. While it is true that matter makes up a small portion of the universe, it is not impossible to hit an object while travelling through hyperspace. Entering coordinates helps reduce the chances of an unexpected collision.

Third, entering coordinates can help a ship avoid travelling through certain areas. For example, if a ship enters coordinates that avoid a particular system, it can help them avoid unwanted attention or dangerous encounters.

Finally, entering coordinates can help a ship stay on course and reach its intended destination. Without coordinates, a ship may find itself drifting off-course or even lost in space. Entering coordinates helps ensure that the ship stays on track and reaches its destination as quickly and efficiently as possible.",0

For example, gender norms and expectations may lead men to be more likely to use aggression and violence in order to exert power, whereas women may be more likely to use emotional manipulation or coercion. Additionally, access to victims is often more available to male perpetrators due to their higher presence in positions of power and authority in society, such as teachers, coaches, or religious leaders.

3214,"There are several reasons why it is difficult to federally tie the minimum wage to inflation. Firstly, the minimum wage is determined by each state and it would be difficult to get all 50 states to agree to the same standards. Secondly, the cost of living can vary greatly between states and regions, which makes it difficult to determine a universal minimum wage. Finally, the labor market is constantly changing due to advances in technology and automation, and it is hard to predict how this will affect the minimum wage in the future. Therefore, tying the minimum wage to inflation may not be the most effective way to ensure that workers are adequately compensated.",0

The FDA also regulates the manufacturing of tobacco products to ensure that they are safe for consumers.

In recent years, governments around the world have been working to address the issue of spam calls, but the problem has been difficult to tackle. In some countries, such as the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has implemented regulations that require telemarketers to obtain prior consent from consumers before making calls. However, these regulations are often difficult to enforce, and many spammers find ways to bypass them. Additionally, the prevalence of caller ID has made it easier for spammers to hide their identities, making it difficult for consumers to identify and report them.

Ultimately, the best way to combat spam calls is for consumers to take steps to protect themselves.

Additionally, ISPs can now block or throttle certain kinds of traffic, such as streaming services or peer-to-peer file sharing.

After months of protests, the Hong Kong government eventually withdrew the bill in September 2019. However, the protests continued and expanded to include demands for greater democracy and autonomy from mainland China.

In June 2020, the Hong Kong government proposed a new national security law that would criminalize secession, subversion, and foreign interference. This law was seen by many as a direct threat to Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom of speech. As a result, protests against the law intensified and spread to other parts of the city.

In October 2020, the Hong Kong government began to crack down on the protests, arresting dozens of activists and enacting harsh restrictions on public gatherings.

However, it’s important to know how to nap properly in order to get the most out of it. Here are some tips on how to nap effectively:

1. Know when to nap. The best time to take a nap is in the early afternoon, between 1 and 3 pm. This is when your body’s circadian rhythm is at its lowest point and you’re likely to be the most tired.

2. Choose the right place. Find a comfortable spot where you can get some peace and quiet. This can be your bed, the couch, or a recliner. Make sure the area is dark and free of distractions, such as loud noises or bright lights.

3. Set a timer. A nap should only last for 20-30 minutes, so it’s a good idea to set a timer so you don’t oversleep. If you do, you could end up feeling groggy and disoriented.

4. Don’t nap too late. Avoid taking naps late in the evening as this can disrupt your sleep cycle and make it harder to fall asleep at night.

5. Drink a cup of coffee. If you’re feeling really tired and need an extra boost, try drinking a cup of coffee before you take a nap. The caffeine will help you wake up feeling refreshed and energized.

Napping can be a great way to get back some energy and improve your productivity. Just make sure you follow these tips to ensure you get the most out of your nap.",0

5010,"On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States issued its landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, which held that a woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy was protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision overturned all state laws that had previously criminalized or restricted access to abortions.

The decision was highly controversial, and it has been the subject of intense debate and numerous challenges over the past four decades. The decision has been reaffirmed by the Court on multiple occasions, most recently in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which reaffirmed the central holding of Roe v. Wade.

At its core, Roe v. Wade established a woman’s right to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy. The Court held that a woman’s right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to her decision whether or not to have an abortion. The Court further held that the right to privacy was not absolute, and that the state had a legitimate interest in protecting the health of the mother and the potential life of the fetus.

The Court also established a framework for evaluating state restrictions on abortion, known as the “undue burden” standard. This standard requires that any state restrictions on abortion must not place an undue burden on a woman’s right to choose. The Court has since applied this standard to numerous state restrictions on abortion, including parental consent laws, waiting periods, and restrictions on the use of public funds for abortion.

The decision in Roe v. Wade has had a profound impact on the legal landscape surrounding abortion rights. It has been the subject of numerous challenges and has been reaffirmed multiple times by the Supreme Court. Despite the fact that Roe v. Wade has been upheld for over four decades, it remains a highly controversial decision and a source of great debate.",0

5081,"It is very understandable and valid to feel frustrated that you are just learning about the Tulsa Massacre at 29 years old. This is a tragedy that should not be overlooked in our history books, and it is a shame that it has not been more widely discussed in the public discourse.

The reasons why this tragedy has been overlooked in the past can be attributed to a variety of factors. One of the main ones is the fact that the event itself was largely ignored and forgotten by the public for many decades, due to the fact that it was considered too embarrassing and controversial. Additionally, the event was not widely discussed in the media at the time, as it was seen as a shameful and embarrassing event for white people to acknowledge.

It is also important to note that the Tulsa Massacre is not the only tragic event in our history that has been overlooked. There are many other events, such as the Red Summer Race Riots of 1919 and the Rosewood Massacre of 1923, which have also been largely forgotten or ignored.

It is important to recognize and learn from the mistakes of our past, so that we can move forward and create a better future. We must not forget the tragedies of our past, as this is the only way to ensure that they are not repeated.",0

However, the news stories are focused on the potential economic and social impacts of these trends. As the population ages and fewer young people enter the workforce, there are concerns that the economy could suffer and that there won’t be enough young people to support the elderly population.

5113,"The decision to euthanize a pet is a difficult one that should be made with careful consideration and compassion. It is often done out of mercy for the animal, to prevent further suffering, or to save the animal from a slow, painful death. With humans, however, the situation is much more complicated. Euthanasia is illegal in most countries, and it is not considered a humane approach to end a person's life. There are other methods of managing extreme pain and suffering, such as hospice care and palliative care, which can provide comfort and dignity to those who are ill and in pain. Additionally, the moral implications of euthanasia are much more complex with humans, as the decision to end a person's life is a much more serious one.",0

The process of being taken away by CPS can be emotionally difficult for the child and their family, but it is done with the goal of providing a safe and secure environment for the child. The CPS caseworker will work with the family to provide resources and assistance that will help the family work towards reunification.

It is important to remember that while being taken away by CPS is not ideal, it is often done to protect the child from potential harm. It is not necessarily as bad as people make it out to be and can be a positive experience if the family is willing to work with the CPS caseworker to ensure a safe and secure environment for the child.",0
5405,"There are a variety of reasons why people are satisfied voting for “the lesser of two evils” instead of pushing for third party candidates to be taken more seriously in American politics. One of the main reasons is that the two-party system is deeply entrenched in American politics and it is difficult for third party candidates to break through and gain traction. This is because the two major parties have financial and organizational advantages that make it difficult for third party candidates to compete. Additionally, the major parties have more resources and are better organized than third parties, giving them a distinct advantage in the electoral process. Another reason is that many people feel that the two major parties are more likely to represent their views and interests than a third party candidate. Finally, the electoral system in the United States is designed to benefit the two major parties, making it more difficult for third parties to gain power.",0
