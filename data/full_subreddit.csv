She opened the cage and he came up to me and sniffed my hand and rubbed his face on my hand. I moved closer to the cage and he leaned up against my chest and purred while I pet him. So of course he was the one. 

Two years later, he follows me around my apartment always sitting next to me. At night when I climb into bed he will be hanging out in the living room while I browse my phone. As soon as I put my phone down and turn off the light, I flip to my right side. Every night since I’ve had him, he runs and jumps into my bed and lays down next to my chest, head resting on my arm. He will lay there until I fall asleep. Every morning, when I wake up he will hear me toss in my bed and run and jump in my bed to greet me. In an otherwise dynamic world that is always changing, he’s been the one constant keeping me grounded.

Some countries have rulers. The people don't choose them and have no say. That's an easy one to figure out. 

Other countries, the ones I assume you're talking about, elect their leaders. 

In places where leaders are elected, rich people and businesses use their money to support the campaigns of the people who are beneficial to their interests. 

Also, people, in general, don't know shit about politics, and don't care. They find a group that agrees with them on a few things that are important to them, and that's what they vote for. 

Those groups usually have a few very agreeable positions to earn votes, and they have many fucked up positions to continue to earn money from donations. 

Because of all this, the organization can continue to rake in money and receive support, while actively working against the majority of their supporters.

Are the Russians truly taking such monumental losses and is their economy soon to be as fucked as people claim?",NoStupidQuestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1376fa010>,1649858528.0,"There's an element of the fact that the west is generally on Ukraine's side, and that we're therefore seeing a Ukraine-centric perspective

But at the same time, the maps don't lie: Russia was expected to roll Ukraine over in a matter of days or weeks, yet is now 7 weeks into the war and have clearly not steamrolled Ukraine or even achieved their likely/apparent goals

There's no way around the fact that Russia clearly (despite their new ""You didn't dump me, I dumped you, I didn't even want to date you in the first place"" narrative) wanted to take Kyiv and enforce regime change. And not only did they not achieve that in the first few days as they clearly expected, and not only have they not achieved it at all... but they've even retreated away from the area and given up on the objective entirely. There's no way to realistically paint that as anything other than an abjact failure

Even if this had been a near-peer conflict (a war between two sides expected to be of roughly equal strength) then the attacker would expected to achieve some major objectives, otherwise why are they attacking at all? But Russia was one of the most feared militaries on the planet and Ukraine barely even a blip on the regional map, and Ukraine fought them to a standstill well short of Russia's objectives.

That's not to say Russia can't get anything out of this war or will have entirely failed - but thus far they've tanked their economy and killed 5-10k of their own men, shattered their military reputation on the world stage, united NATO and the EU, started Germany on a re-militarization path, pushed Finland and Sweden into NATO's hands, and is still nowhere near to even achieving their ""fallback"" goals of taking the entirety of Donbas.

It's possible that Russia could have a successful offensive in the east and take the rest of Donbas and secure Mariupol (which looks inevitable), on top of the canal supplying Crimea's water which has already been captured. You could consider that Russia has, at that point, achieved enough objectives to be worth the invasion - but the cost for that has been huge and it's hard to argue that it's been worthwhile

The only thing Russia has *really* achieved is to secure the Crimean water supply, and to ensure Ukraine doesn't join NATO... but that was already off the table since 2014, all Russia had to do was continue quietly supporting the existing war in Donbas and Ukraine was going to stay out of NATO anyway",14063

Anything which diminishes that tool must be minimized in order to maximize the usefulness of the tool. Basically we have a few motivating factors here, one is the desire to sustain a lavish lifestyle utilizing a much smaller amount of liquid assets, so paying 25% of 300 million will actually lower their ability to own all those fancy houses and yachts and rub elbows with politicians and officials. Second, is the desire to utilize wealth to productively to make more wealth. While a few million less may not be substantial, those few million may be worth 10x or 100x if properly invested, so the pain of that tax is many times multiples. Third the desire to avoid taxes on assets which is a whole separate discussion around property rights, but when 98% percent of your worth is in assets, you sure don’t want that to happen.",18342

TL;DR: I live in Kyiv. People are split, but no one really wants to aknowledge the fact that we might be on the brink of war with (the better word would probably be 'destruction by') russia. Like, what's the point in talking about it? So we don't. Government just issued a leaflet about what to have in your medkit and how to behace in case of artillery strikes, so there's that. News are bleak, you don't know what to believe, maybe it's propaganda, maybe it's the boy who cried 'wolf', maybe it's a distraction. Fireworks went out yesterday (which are by the way illegal due to veterans with PTSD from war) and I was scared it was a strike. I'm prone to anxiety so maybe I'm not the most objective spectator, but it's fucking hard. You either read the news and realize it gets worse and worse, or you stick your head into the sand and wish it would all go away.

1) A running joke at that time but also 100% accurate is: ""You just need 2 things to survive, your life and your passport"".


Have your documents ready. Passport is king, but university/high school/education diplomas/immunization records...Anything that vouchers for who you are what you have accomplished will help you get thru borders or refugee camps or visas. If you leave your place and you can carry only one thing it's documentation.


2) Fill up your bathroom tub with water. You can drain it as needed for personal hygiene as long as you have running water but always have it full afterwards if you do not know when you're going to lose it. 


3) go get gasoline. Fill up your car if you have one. And buy canisters and fill them up. Gas is worth more than gold when stations run dry. And they will. People will kill each other over it so hide it and don't tell anyone you have it. You can use it for your own needs, you can sell it later, you can trade it. Cash won't be worth much as inflation is going to render cash worthless. Gas will be the new cash. And if you did put it in your vehicle someone will siphon it out quickly. So hide the car too :)


4) go get candles. Better and cheaper than batteries. Can be somewhat reused as long as you keep the wax.


5) go buy a tub of lard. It's winter so it'll keep for a while if power runs out and shouldn't be expensive now. Get lots of crackers and if you can, paprika powder. Crackers + lard + paprika = tons of calories and tastes ok. You can also take this stuff with you if you need to make a getaway.


6) list is getting long and there are many nice to haves but your life is most important so if you can get one more thing get bags of nuts. Walnuts/peanuts/whatever-you-can get-your-hands-on nuts = calories (and they won't spoil)


Now you have water and calories and light. With gas and paperwork you're better off than most people in the same situation. So be careful who you share that with.

Last note to hopefully put your mind at ease, the invading force will go after militarily targets first. Stay clear and you'll be relatively safe. If you find that you must run...lie, cheat and trust very few (if any) as you make your run. Unless there are genocidal atrocities (rare, but happen) you will make it.

Edit- Santa seems to be a really emotional subject still for a lot of people. My original comment was made quite casually.  I should clarify that I'm not suggesting we cancel Christmas. The issue I have is that we generally feed kids this idea that there is a godlike figure who will pass judgement on how good or bad you are, but then doesn't even follow his own rules, because he gave your bully more gifts than he gave you. I am not in denial that shitty things still happen to good people either. It's a big hot topic in schools right now to help children be resilient and we do that whenever opportunities arise.  But as adults we are in control of how we explain the mythology of Santa and set up whatever traditions we want to follow. Let's just be mindful and show a little empathy while we do so. At our house Santa gives one modest gift and fills your stocking, everything else is from family and friends.

I had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

124,Is it possible that my adult girlfriend doesn’t know how to read?,"I’m 21/M, she’s 19/F.

I feel like I’m going crazy, but I’m pretty sure that my girlfriend has been hiding the fact that she’s illiterate. We’ve been dating for about six months, and here are the things I’ve noticed in that time:

* She never texts me, she only ever wants to talk on the phone. Any time I’ve ever texted her, she’s either called me in response or else just doesn’t respond to it at all. She claims that this is because she just hates texting.
* She works as a barista; she told me a story about how they changed the Point of Sale system they use and she was screwing up orders for a week because she used to just “have it memorized where everything was in the system”.
* Whenever we go to a restaurant, she always says she’s not sure what she wants and asks me what I think she should try. 90% of the time she also asks me to order for her. I’m not sure if she actually really looks at the menu.
* She rarely captions photos on her IG, usually just emojis. Also this is the only social media that she has.
* She was in the foster care system and moved around a lot as a child, which could explain disrupted schooling.
* She isn’t in college and has no interest in going, she said because she always struggled in school and sees no reason to subject herself to it as an adult.
* I’ve never seen her read a book or even a magazine, and when I see her on her phone she’s usually on IG or playing Match 3 games but never reading an article that I can remember.
* I once let her borrow my copy of the book that her favorite movie is based on, because she mentioned that she’d never read it. She gave it back to me a few weeks later claiming that she never found time to read it and felt bad that she was holding it hostage.

Am I crazy, or does it sound like I’m onto something here? And should I ask her about it? I can’t imagine anything more insulting than asking someone if they’re illiterate, especially because I sometimes get the feeling that she feels like I’m “smarter than her” because I’m in college and she isn’t.

127,Do Americans really buy milk by the gallon?,"I mean, that’s like 8 pints of milk in one go? 4.5 litres of milk? How does it even fit in the fridge? How can you use it all before it goes off? What on Earth are you guys doing with all that milk?

EDIT: OK, so a US Gallon (3.7 litres) is only slightly bigger than a UK 6 pint bottle (3.4 litres), and not a 4.5 litre monstrosity. American milk also takes 2 weeks to go off, everyone has 5 children, a fridge the size of a Volkswagen, and drinks a pint of milk with every meal.

EDIT2: Lots of people just read the title, and not the text (on reddit, who knew?). So this edit probably won't stem that tide, but I'm going to clarify the question, and what I have learned from the many answers. 

My question was 'why do Americans buy milk in such a ridiculously impractical single unit as a gallon?' It's like someone saying 'oh, just grab me one of those 10 kilo salmon from the store on the way home?' and everyone just nodding like it's not completely insane for a grocery store to stock a single 10 kilo salmon, and for a person to then lug it home and consume the whole thing before it goes off. 

What prompted this question was watching The Taking of Pelham 123, where they make a really big deal of him coming home with a gallon of milk, and it made me think 'why on Earth would you buy milk by the gallon? Because here in the UK, which some people don't know is also populated by milk-drinking humans, the largest milk size is 6 pints, not 8 pints.' The reasons why this does in fact happen are twofold, and by asking a nostupidquestion, I have now been enlightened with them: 

1. The US pint is much smaller than the UK pint, so a US 8-pint gallon is actually 3.7 litres, not the 4.5 litres of a UK gallon. So the bottle itself is only a half pint (0.3l) larger than the largest size in the UK, not the whole extra litre of milk that I imagined. It seems the largest size commonly available is 4 litres in Canada, which is sold in a bag. Europeans point out that even the 3.4l / 6 pint bottle in the UK is an absurd size. They are also right, because there is nothing worse than wanting a splash of milk for a cup of tea, and realising you have to upend a full 3.4l ewer to pour out 0.005l of milk. I've never worked in an industrial foundry, but attempting this feat gives a man insight to the challenges of that profession. 

None of this by itself explains why an individual would commonly buy milk by the gallon, until I learned:

2. American milk is more thoroughly/aggressively pasteurised than UK milk, and has a usable life of several weeks. In the UK, milk from the store will have a shelf life of about a 7-10 days, and once the bottle is opened, it'll last about 4-5 days. So all of you who are commenting 'I live by myself and get through a gallon every week' are simply reiterating my point about why buying milk by the gallon seems so absurd. If you bought a 6 pint bottle of milk in the UK and opened it on Monday, by Sunday it's going to be absolutely minging (or 'gross') and completely undrinkable. That's why individuals buy smaller quantities of milk, but more regularly, even if they also consume a gallon of milk over a week. 

Finally, on behalf of the American dairy industry, may I thank all those commenters that single-handedly bear whole families of dairy farmers upon their calcium-rich shoulders. America salutes you. I myself can only wonder, do you piss, or just break off the stalactite that forms at the end of your knob?

I also fucked up by enabling emails when people reply to posts, so I can also share that when people say 'RIP inbox' its just all the post replies arriving as email notifications, and not the poster receiving loads of messages that you can't see. Good day to you all.

EDIT3: To be clear to those who didn't get this through implication, I'm well aware you can buy milk in smaller quantities than a gallon. If somebody asked 'why do you have $1,000 bills,' they're not asking because they think you pay for everything with $1,000 bills, they're wondering why such an evidently impractical thing would exist in the first place.",NoStupidQuestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x173ee88d0>,1635878616.0,"You can buy milk in half gallons and quarts here.

142,Someone please help me understand my trans child.,"This is not potstirring or political or time for a rant. Please. My child is a real person, and I'm a real mom, and I need perspective. 

I have been a tomboy/low maintenance woman most of my life. My first child was born a girl. From the beginning, she was super into fashion and makeup. When she was three, her babysitter took her to get nails and hair extensions, and she loved it. She grew into watching makeup and fashion boys, and has always been ahead of the curve. 

Not going to lie, it's been hard for me. I've struggled to see that level of interest in outward appearance as anything but shallow. But I've tried to support her with certain boundaries, which she's always pushed. For example, she had a meltdown at 12yo because I wouldn't buy her an $80 6-color eyeshadow palette. But I've held my nose and tried. 

You might notice up until now, I've referred to her as ""she/her."" That's speaking to how it was then, not misgendering. About two years ago, they went through a series of ""coming outs."" First lesbian, then bi, then pan, then male, then non-binary, then female, now male again. I'm sure I missed a few, but it's been a roller coaster. They tasted the whole rainbow. Through all of this, they have also been dealing with serious issues like eating disorders, self harm, abuse recovery, compulsive lying, etc.

Each time they came out, it was this big deal. They were shaky and afraid, because I'm religious and they expected a big blowup. But while I'm religious, I apply my religion to myself not to others. I've taught them what I believe, but made space for them to disagree. I think they were disappointed it wasn't more dramatic, which is why the coming outs kept coming. 

Now, they are comfortable with any pronouns. Most days they go by she/her, while identifying as a boy. (But never a man.) Sometimes, she/her offends them. I've defaulted to they as the least likely to cause drama, but I don't think they like my overall neutrality with the whole process. 

But here is the crux of my question. As someone who has never subscribed to gender norms, what does it when mean to identify as a gender? I've never felt ""male"" or ""female."" I've asked them to explain why they feel like a boy, how that feels different than feeling like a girl or a woman,  and they can't explain it. I don't want to distress them by continuing to ask, so I came here. 

Honestly, the whole gender identity thing completely baffles me. I don't see any meaning in gender besides as a descriptor of biological differences. I've done a ton of online research and never found anything that makes a lick of sense to me. 

Any insight?

Edit: wow. I wasn't expecting such an outpouring of support. Thank you to everyone who opened up your heart and was vulnerable to a stranger on the internet. I hope you know you deserve to be cared about. 

Thank you to everyone who sent me resources and advice. It's going to take me weeks to get through everything and think about everything, and I hope I'm a better person in the other side. 

I'm so humbled by so many of the responses. LGBTQ+ and religious perspectives alike were almost all unified on one thing: people deserve love, patience, respect, and space to not understand everything the right way right now. My heart has been touched in ways that had nothing to do with this post, and were sorely needed. Thank you all. I wish I could respond to everyone. Every single one of you deserve to be seen.

You start with a hook, then your main point (this is also where you say ""I don't necessarily disagree with your side"" so you don't piss people off), and sometimes crack a bit of a joke at the end. You use decent grammar otherwise Redditors will say your point isn't valid because you're stupid, and Reddit is too cool for emojis so you don't use them unless it's in very specific situations in an ironic way.

163,Can everyone else smell pregnancy or do I have the lamest super power ever?,"To explain the backstory of this, I have to go back a bit.
When I was a young boy, the first time I met a pregnant women was at the business place of my father. We had a little party that day, and I remember when she entered the room there was a very strong (and unpleasant) smell. Me being a kid and meeting a pregnant woman for the first time, I assumed either that's just the way they smelt, or it was a coincidence. 
    
As I grew up I met very few pregnant woman face to face, I had a very isolated childhood, but I did notice that smell only appeared when I was in a crowded place, and frequently I would be able to spot a pregnant woman somewhere in the crowd, or a woman with a baby. 

I always assumed that the reason nobody mentioned it was because it would be rude, but as I've gotten older I realize that I have never in my life heard anyone mention it. Not even an acknowledgment of the smell. This is strange to me considering it is a VERY strong smell. Virtually any room with a pregnant woman in it has smelt like that throughout, and considering its kind of a gross smell, I can't imagine EVERYONE staying silent about it.

I brought it up to some friends recently, and they had no idea what I was talking about. This prompted me to Google it, I found nothing regarding this, many articles spoke of increased B.O but this smell is completely unique, not like B.O. 

I justified it as a coincidence until just a few days ago, I was in a Starbucks staring out the window, waiting for my drink. When I smelt the smell, I turned around and in the doorway was a pregnant woman. This confirmed it for me, I now have no uncertainty that all pregnant women smell like this.

Before everyone had a computer, it was common that you had to draw up neat documents or term papers by hand writing. It's easier to do this in cursive because you don't have to lift the pen from the paper as often, which is easier on your hands.

Also, in pre-Victorian times (think Jane Austen) paper was expensive. People would often fit multiple sheets' worth of information onto one sheet by crossing their lines -- writing like normal on one page, portrait oriented, then turning the paper 90 degrees and writing again landscape on top of the portrait-oriented text. The result looked like a grid. But the thing is, because of the way our brains work, this is actually legible in cursive because our brains naturally filter out the vertical text and decipher the words until we turn the paper. This works with cursive, but doesn't work with print.

Cursive is not a necessity in the modern world, but the curriculum just hasn't been updated.

Edit: Nah, y'all are right, it's not that cursive is no longer relevant - it's true there are still applications for it. Just, MOST people don't strictly need it day to day any longer and have the option of opting out of using it. I think it's important to learn it as a child even if you don't use it later, because it at least teaches you to read cursive. And if you want to pick it up again as an adult it's easier if you already have the muscle memory. 

TBH I actually write in cursive and I find it useful, but I do find that more and more people can't read my handwriting. Which is sad because I struggle to write in print and my disability makes it harder to print than to write cursive.

If she's a lab then the fact that you exist creates a bond. They're generally *extremely* friendly dogs, so you don't have to actually do a whole lot other than feed her and she'll think you're awesome. Playing would be high on her list of things to do as well. Fetch will probably be her favorite activity since labs, and their cousins golden retrievers, absolutely *love* to bring things back to their person. She'll easily do that for as long as you want to throw a ball for her. Walks would be good too, though she'll probably want to stop and sniff everything that a squirrel or neighborhood cat has ever come near.

>Doggo is frightened and scared when I saw her. Finally got her to eat when I got on the floor, rolled over to show my belly.

The fact that you got her to calm down and eat is a great start. Good job!

Make sure you get her some toys if she doesn't already have any. Labs are smart and if they don't have something to do they'll get bored and can be destructive and start chewing on things.

171,My 69 yr old neighbors alarm clock has been going off since 8am.,"-She has a hard time balancing without her walker.

-Last night I had to help bring her laundry to her apartment because she couldn't do it herself.

-I knocked on her door multiple times and called out her name. I couldn't hear anything except the alarm clock.

-I called 911 to ask for a welfare check. They said they would send someone over. Its been an hour so far and I havent heard anything back.

What else can I do? I'm concerned and anxious and dont know what else to do. She told me she's alone and she was so out of breath just trying to go up the curb to the sidewalk last night, I'm scared she may have fallen.


UPDATE: I heard a lot of sirens go by but since I live right next to a fire dept and a hospital, I wasn't sure If it was for my neighbor or unrelated issue. I went by to check on her. The alarm clock stopped. But she still didnt answer. I will try to find out what happened.


UPDATE 2: Everyone is wanting an update and so am I. I am getting different answers on who I am supposed to call for an update. Do I call dispatch again? A non-emergency number? My local PD?

I'm going to try and answer the most common questions:

-I have crazy social anxiety and I'm scared If I try to just walk in her place or break a window inside, its gonna make things a lot worse or awkward. I'm worried if I show too much concern like knocking on her door again or calling someone, people will think I'm crazy.

-I plan on walking by again to check on her.

UPDATE 3: I went by to check again. No answer. The alarm clock was off so I want to safely assume that she either turned it off that night when someone did a welfare check or someone else did and helped her. I called two local PD's in my area but since it's Sunday I've been getting redirected to answering machines. Im going to try again Monday morning because at this point I dont think knocking on her door every few hours is going to do anything. Another redditor commented that since she has a hard time walking she might not want to use the energy to come to the door for just a check up.

LAST UPDATE: SHE'S OK!!! My local PD finally called me back around 3 today. I asked for a follow-up regarding the welfare check on Saturday night. They said someone came by and she answered and shes okay. He adult son was there too. The reason for the alarm clock going off all day was because due to her limited immobility she couldn't reach to turn it off. 

It raises more questions if I'm being honest. Like, why didnt her son turn off the alarm until someone came by?

186,Is it a red flag liking Andrew Tate?,"So this guy I’m kinda dating (26) recently told me that he likes Andrew Tate. As in he listens to his podcasts and actually agrees with most of the things he says. He did say that he doesn’t agree on how he views women; however, everything else he is fine with. Honestly, we’ve talked about this topic so much that I can safely say that this grown man is a fan of Andrew Tate. I, on the other hand, completely disagree with Andrew Tate. To be fair, I have only seen what Tik Tok has shown me on him, but I think I get the gist of his ideals. I think that this is a major red flag, but I want to see what y’all think.

EDIT: Just want to clarify to those saying that I should “decide for myself”… I don’t have the need to dive in more into what he says because the few things that I’ve heard, even if they’re on Tik Tok or YouTube or reels, wherever, I don’t agree and are the complete opposite to what I believe in. Like I said, I think it’s a red flag and was just curious what other people had to say.

EDIT2: A lot of people are mad about “I have only seen what TikTok has shown…” Why should I watch long videos or listen to podcasts starring someone who is constantly degrading me and encouraging his audience to do the same?

188,"In a world where unimaginable amounts of money are moved around electronically every day, millions of online transactions are processed every minute, and I can pay my taxes, file returns, and renew my drivers license online - why is voting online “not safe” or insecure?",,NoStupidQuestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2843d5b10>,1604824945.0,"There are three things that must be true for voting:

1. It must be accurate- each voter must be able to vote exactly once and their vote must be correctly recorded
2. It must be anonymous- no one must be able to tell who voted for which candidate, so you can't be pressured to vote a particular way.
3. It must be verifiable- all sides involved must be able to verify that the first two things are true. You shouldn't need to trust anyone

The problem with online voting is number 3. There's no way to make sure that your vote is accurately recorded without being able to trace your individual vote. With traditional voting, there are observers seeing with their own eyes that things are being done correctly. But you can't observe an online vote. Even if I show you a computer program that counts votes correctly, there's no way for me to prove that the computer program running on the server is the same program I showed you, or that there isn't some other program off to the side messing with the data. 

The reason online banking works is because it doesn't care about being anonymous- every transaction you make is tied to your identity. You can see every transaction made in your name and verify them after the fact, even on the phone or in a brink and mortar bank if you don't trust the computer and you can contest any discrepancies. But that can't be allowed in voting.

Thanks again to everyone.",NoStupidQuestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2884ec750>,1610389136.0,"So a lot of people are missing some crucial pieces here, but here's the whole summary: 

1. Unexpected things. A lot of people did touch on this. Sometimes the patient prior to you drops a bomb mid-appt or even worse, when your hand is on the door to leave. If someone is here for wrist pain and then goes ""oh yeah doc...my chest hurts real bad every time I exercise."" You cannot ignore that, they could have a life threatening concern. So now your 15 min appt becomes 30. 


2. Other people running late. I don't mean just patients. A clinic involves a LOT of people. Patients, front desk, nurses, MAs, etc etc. If one runs late, so do the others.


3. Paperwork. Y'all are seriously underestimating how much paperwork needs to be done. Every single patient has to have a note typed out, a diagnosis (usually multiple) made, everything you order has to be justified and associated with a diagnosis (even things like flu shots or med reorders), every thing you order has to be confirmed as correct, meds and lab work have to be confirmed to the correct insurance, you might have to get a print out of your referrals/visit summary. Doctors work very very hard to do as much of this as they go, but it cannot always be done. Also, lots of people get annoyed if a doctor is typing while they talk, so then you cannot do any of this as you go.


3. They don't make the schedule. The majority of doctors are not in charge of booking patients, they hire people specifically for that. Doctors get over booked, and because the clinic or hospital they work for cares about $$$, they make doctors see as many people as possible. Doctors usually have set amounts of time depending on the appt type, and you can't always just add a random 10 minutes here or there. I promise you the majority of doctors would rather have more time to talk to you too and aren't trying to just see you as a cash cow, but it is literally out of their control. 


4. You can (technically) wait to be seen, they can't wait to see people. Does it suck if you've been living with indigestion and your appointment to finally see the doctor about it got canceled? Absolutely and it's okay to be mad about that. But nobody died from an upset stomach, and as aforementioned, late patients simply have no room in the schedule because it's tightly regulated. If what you tell the office you need to be seen for is important enough the doctor won't cancel your appointment. (And now you're why the next patient is being seen late, but see 1. Unexpected Stuff)


5. A lot of offices still really push to get late people in. We really want to see you, and we'll do what we can, but it isn't always possible. 


6. Doctors have lives too. Every late appointment makes it harder and harder to get home on time, eat lunch, pee, etc. Doctors don't owe you their well being. 


I probably missed some stuff but the way medical offices run is a pretty complex issue and while it could be handled better, a lot of it has nothing to do with the doctor. If your doctor always runs late in that bothers you, go see a new one, but I promise most of them are trying their best to keep everybody happy, including themselves.",8640

Its not that hard to shift your sleep cycle.  It wouldn't be great to be sleeping on the floor but if you were doing that I think you could last quite a while

You are making 8 x $100 = $800 a day

$800 x 7 = $5,600 a week

$800 x 30 = $24,000 a month

I think I could bang out a fair few month and put together quite a sum of money.

Edit for more thoughts:

OP gives more details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/xqibik/comment/iq9c8gs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and in other replies (in particular saying yes to sleep and that it is a 9-to-5 shift)

So its $800 x 365 = $292,000 a year (less taxes?).

Since you are sleeping, you could pursue some other form of employment in your off time. though that  might be more for the sake of keeping yourself busy than anything else, and you might be better off studying or otherwise preparing yourself for leaving this weird lifestyle you now live in the best possible position.

The more I think about this, the more it seems like someone who is young with few responsibilities could do this for quite a long period (perhaps years). I'm assuming that for the vast majority of people reading that the above income would be a major upgrade to their income.

So thinking of reasons you would stop taking this deal (not an exhaustive list):

* Body Breakdown. I think sleeping on a bare floor is survivable for a long time.  Especially if you can afford help with massage and stretching etc.
* Social Life.  This would wear on you.  You're missing 9 to 5 every day including weekends.  You'll be coming in late to weddings (likely just the reception) and parties etc.  I think if your friends were aware of your weird bargain they would play along but it would definitely be a negative
* Medical Emergencies.  Either you or a loved one having a medical emergency is something that likely would break the streak.
* Death of a loved one.  Again this is likely going to break your streak.
* Family commitments.  So if you already had a partner and especially if you had young children this feels like it would make it a lot harder to pull off.  Especially if kid-related emergencies come up.
* Traffic, or car problems.  This would be the super frustrating thing.  It sounds like OP intends that if you don't turn up on time it would break the rules and break the bargain.  Having something screw up so you can't *get* to this facility might eventually happen, especially if you are looking at doing this for the longer term (months or years)

Edit for potential game changer. Do weekends exist in this scenario?

* If we assume you can take weekends off the yearly income becomes roughly $208,000
* But now you can lift a lot of the social life and family commitment pressures. It also means you can unlock some short travel opportunities (though that is playing with fire if something goes wrong)

Edit for a question that is being asked

Is there a bathroom? It sounds like the answer is no

* Its an 8 hour shift where you are sleeping most of it
* Getting through that without pooping should be quite feasible (if making for the occasional uncomfortable day)
* With your lunch option you can add the option for relieving yourself in whatever held your beverage.

Edit because it keeps getting said

* Yes you should probably assume you would be taxed on this.  

Another Edit:

* Yes the OP does not specify the time of day.  But if you look at OP's replies elsewhere (I linked one above) they do specify its a 9-to-5.",6355
224,Is anyone else having problems with watching movies and constantly having to do volume up and down because the dialogue is too quiet and the background music is too loud?,,NoStupidQuestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x28a07edd0>,1586757440.0,"You're watching movies that were released in 5.1 surround, but on a stereo system (like a TV, or computer speakers). The stereo system is doing a poor job of ""re-mixing"" the 5.1 sound for stereo. There's usually a setting for this on the TV or on the movie player (DVD player, games console, etc), usually called something like ""Speaker Setup"" or ""demux"" if it's a fancy player, and it'll let you choose between e.g. speakers, soundbar, headphones...

In a 5.1 movie mix, the dialogue is usually positioned in the front-centre speaker, because the dialogue is almost always happening on-screen and should take priority over anything else the audience hears. Music usually appears in the front-left and front-right speakers, and effects can come from anywhere. When a stereo system mixes those 5 speakers together, it usually just squashes the front-left and rear-left signals together, the front-right and rear-right signals together, applying ""compression"" to the signals. This isn't like MP3 compression, it's an audio effect that makes quiet sounds louder, but doesn't affect loud sounds. This is to make up for the fact that your TV speakers probably aren't as loud as the speakers in a cinema.

It then plays the centre signal across both speakers, but reduces the level of the centre signal to compensate for it now appearing in two speakers. And sometimes, the centre signal gets reduced too much, and is drowned out by the compressed music and effects, which results in the dialogue being hard to hear.

But like I say, your TV or player device or even things like VLC give you some control over how the 5.1 signal is mixed, and how much compression should be applied.

---

This is now my most popular comment ever. Thanks for all the upvotes, and kind strangers for the awards. Here's some FAQs from my inbox:

**I have a 5.1 surround system, and I still get this problem.**

Boost the volume of your centre speaker. Ideally, get your system calibrated. If it was an expensive system, the shop that sold it to you should do this for you. If it wasn't expensive, there are online guides and phone apps that will help you.

**But I thought audio compression made loud sounds quieter, not the other way around?**

There are two kinds of compressors. A _downward_ compressor is the more well-known, and people who are familiar with recording audio will be most familiar with downwards compressors. These do indeed work by attenuating the signal when it goes above a given threshold, i.e. making the loud sounds quieter. But they give a different character to the signal above the threshold, which is great for making a kick drum sound massive while ensuring that it doesn't clip the recorder, but it isn't what we want here. 

Since the signal from a DVD has already been recorded and mixed by a professional, we know that it sounds great, so we don't want to alter the peaks in the signal, we _only_ want to amplify the low level sounds. For that, we need an _upward_ compressor. This works exactly as I describe; by raising the level of signals below a given threshold, i.e. making quiet sounds louder. You hardly ever find them in recording studios, but they're very common in broadcast audio and in hi-fi devices, which is what you'd classify a DVD player as.

Note that upward compressors are not just downward compressors with make-up gain. They're a completely different circuit design or algorithm.",4934

I'd like to point out that [other comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ijdde9/why_do_people_say_tuna_fish_when_they_dont_say/g3cv0au?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) suggest it might have something to do with influence from other Germanic languages specifically when it comes to canned tuna.

Maybe I'll also add that shredded tuna is also sometimes sold in plastic (I've brought this hiking because the leftover trash is a bit lighter / easier to compress) -- I think I'd still tend to call this ""tuna fish"".

&#x200B;

\*\*EDIT 2:\*\* I also did not know that the word ""tuna"" [also refers to a type of prickly pear fruit](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ijdde9/why_do_people_say_tuna_fish_when_they_dont_say/g3djx7y?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and where I'm from it's uncommon to see any form of prickly pear. I'd tend to believe that the reason for the usage is independent of prickly pear considerations (if only because the proportion of Americans \[the whole usage apparently being an American thing judging from the comments\] living in prickly pear-producing regions has historically been small (though increasing in the last several decades).",8682
235,Cat is in labor. Should I intervene?,"Posted in another sub, but I'm hoping to get answers quick. 

I took in a pregnant cat. 

An amniotic sac (unaware if there's a kitten inside) has been hanging out of her vagina for about an hour. 

She has not been pushing and due to the COVID issue there are no emergency vets open or taking calls in my area. 

It's a small bubble, half the size of a ping pong ball. 

She also won't allow me to walk away or stop petting her at all.

As far as I'm aware this is her first litter.




**UPDATE**: Luna (momma) is doing just fine and has had 6 kittens so far. From some gentle pats and belly rubs I'm guessing there's one more in there and she's just taking a rest. 

Thank you all so much for your incredible advice and support. ❤

We did end up naming the kitten Prin, short for Prince/Princess.

**UPDATE #2**: 7th is here safe and sound. Pictures posted.

242,How should we handle our 23 y/o son who doesn't want to work?,"Hello Reddit. My wife and I just don't know what to do with our son. He is 23 years old, he just sit on his computer and chat online and play video games all day. He's not in college or anything. Said he tried applying and got accepted, but applying for financial aid was too confusing so he gave up. We kept asking him to keep trying but he won't budge. Within the past 2-3 years, he worked about 2-3 jobs, all of which he wasn't able to keep for more than a year and spent all his money on expensive computer parts and games. Each time we asked why he quit, he said he didn't like the job. I spoke to him multiple times, but one time he opened up a bit and said he finds life to be depressing. He finds the cycle of waking up, going to work, go home, sleep, and repeat depressing and doesn't want to do that for the rest of his life. He said he wanted to have a passion in something, but he can't find what he likes. He barely exit his room. Only to shower, restroom, and food. Otherwise, he stays in his room.

At this point, me and my wife wants to help him. But we don't know what to do. We've thinking of kicking him out, but I'm not sure I want to do that.

So I want to try and ask online for some opinions of other parents who are potentially in similar situations. How can we help our son?

Update - So after reading some of the posts here (sorry, I haven't replied. I didn't think it would explode like this), I decided to go give him the talk again. Asked him things like if he was willing to try therapy. He said he is willing to try anything. We chatted for a few hours, and he opened up a lot more. He told me he feels stuck, like his life is now at a stagnant and only resort to working 9-5 jobs. He also confessed that he felt guilty living like this under us and does want to change, just doesn't know where to begin since there is so many resources and he feels very lost. I asked him if his mom and I were to die today, what would he do? He said he'd be very screwed since he doesn't know anything. He also said he's already been applying for jobs here and there but no one would respond. I showed him Indeed and asked him to apply there. He said it's just a bunch of outdated or fake listing and he doesn't trust it. In the end, we decided to end the conversation with an agreement that he will go to therapy, and he has 4 months to get a job. Then I will charge him rent money. He agreed to that idea.  

That is one step towards the right direction. I really pray that we can help him. All we wanted was to raise and see our son grow up and be independent. I see that perhaps we were too lenient towards him. But nonetheless, we will do whatever we can to help him. 

Thanks for the support reddit.

It's not a simple answer.

The phrase was *initially* popularized by Biggie Smalls in the song [""Get Money.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7AGFAcwY3U) The song is about being betrayed by a woman, but also how he enjoys women in much the same way. It's a consistent theme throughout his music. He talks about being misogynistic, while also legitimately being in love, while also being a victim himself because he falls in love with very flawed women, all together. The hook is ""Fuck bitches, get money"". This hook would infamously be mocked on 2Pac's diss song [""Hit Em Up.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU)

The best example of this (and maybe my favorite Biggie song) is [""Me and My Bitch""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rueScMSnRP4). At the start he says ""Me and my bitch"" like a young kid with an arm piece, bragging. Then he says ""Me and my bitch"" in the second verse, using bitch as an almost empowering term, like yeah she's a bad bitch who stands her ground and I like her for that. Then in the third verse, where he finds her murdered, he's crying ""Me and my bitch"", saying it ironically and painfully nostalgically because at this point he truly loved her *because* she was rough around the edges.

This is the same in ""Get Money."" He switches back and forth in the song. Some of the lines are about him fucking bitches, others about getting money, others about being betrayed by women (fuck bitches).

But it doesn't stop there. In 2005, Lil Wayne released [""Money On My Mind""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ffu7u9gvSU) on Tha Carter II in which the hook references the ""Fuck Bitches, Get Money"" line from the Biggie Song. This is where it became memed on the internet, and when it became reintroduced to the public, a decade later. And with this line, a lot of the context was lost, and nobody really knew which way it meant because when it first came out (and remember, even still today Biggie is one of the highest selling rap artists of all time along with OutKast, Kanye, Eminem, Tupac and others) specifically because of the reasons I mentioned above.

So, the answer is it's a double entendre on purpose. Neither one is the right answer. Thus, the genius of Christopher George Latore Wallace aka Notorious B.I.G.

If it’s not already obvious, I have anxiety. I also haven’t ever “crashed” at someone’s place before after a night out. I don’t know what to do and I’m worried about doing the wrong thing.

I ended up sending a text to say thank you and to let her know I was leaving as I was gathering my things (made sure to clean up and make the bed), just as she was getting up. She told me to stay, so we had some breakfast together and I confessed to her that I hadn’t really known what to do with myself, which she found funny and assured me it would have been fine either way, but she was glad she caught me before I left.

I also probably should have mentioned that she's a fairly new friend that I'm still not entirely comfortable around yet so I felt a lot of pressure to give a good impression, especially with her being nice enough to let me stay at her place. I also appreciate a lot of people pointing out that it seems like she could be interested in forming a closer relationship with me, which is really reassuring. I think she's a really cool person and I'd love to form a closer bond with her, so I'm glad that seems to be how she feels too. I can't really say for certain whether that bond will involve romance, but I'm just glad to have someone like her in my life.

> ORIGINAL POST AS FOLLOWS -

Hey, I figured it out partially and I got chills man.

It's ASCII.

After translating it, it reads:

38 34 32 34 39 39 2e 37 38 2d 20 34 31 35 34 30 36 2e 36 33 20 67 61 62 20 64 65 72 20 61 20 6e 69 u r alone now dont come after me

Do these numbers mean anything to you?

Man, I got the CHILLS.

It would help if you could tell us where you live (country) or if there's anything near you. Maybe figure out what the significance of these numbers are. Also it feels like there's someone who thinks that you are after THEM. So maybe it's got to do with where you park every day, or a place you pass by regularly, and someone recognizes your car?

EDIT: (compiling data) (clarifications)

The string of numbers then translates to ""842499.78- 415406.63 gab der a ni""
which reads 'in a red bag 36.064514 -87.994248' backwards (Thanks, u/Nrutasnz)

The coordinates point to the middle of Tibet, China. A place which is impossible to Google Map due to the restrictions on data. Might have to use Bai Du or something.

Shuanghu, Nagqu, Tibet, China https://www.google.com.sg/maps/place/36%C2%B003'52.3%22N+87%C2%B059'39.3%22E/@36.0700036,87.943404,28944m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d36.064514!4d87.994248

For people getting results in the middle of Michigan, remember that for google maps, the proper way to insert coordinates is with a comma. I had to change the string from (36.064514 -87.994248) to (36.064514, 87.994248) which then shows up in the very center of China. The placement of the pin feels too exact to be a coincidence, and leads me to believe that the China coordinates are the correct one. It also adds to my theory below. But I'll still admit it's all a big guess!

EDIT 2: (thoughts)

I don't know if this is really the thing, but you mentioned that it was your birthday soon. I live in Asia, and we have a tradition here where we give money to our friends on certain occasions in what we call 'ang bao'. It translates directly to 'red bag', and is also a Chinese tradition. The coordinates lead to as central of China as you can get. Perhaps this is trying to tell you that someone's gonna give you a big fat stack of cash soon.

Or kill you, I dunno.

EDIT 3:
I came to the realisation after that negative coordinates also work. I'm not trying to weasel out of this. I'll put my hand up to the oversight. That said, I would still have figured China due to the very odd pin placement that read far more to me like a purposeful move.

Now that it's solved, congrats OP on your birthday trip to China! You have some good friends indeed.",4909

So I have this friend, I went to college and studied abroad with him. So he's decently educated and has lived outside the USA for a while. When he graduated he moved out of the city into more of a rural suburban setting, working remote 5 days per week. I have noticed his views progressively separating from much of his peers.  


Since Covid, he's gone down a bit of a rabbit hole with a lot of right wing ideologies. I made a comment about how expensive groceries are getting, and he just blurts out ""because Biden is a fucking idiot and everyone who voted for him is an idiot"". I commented back that the global economy is a very complex topic, and blaming whoever happens to be sitting in office isn't a fair reasoning, nor saying that people who voted for him are dumb. He just said ""Ever since sleepy joe has been in office, the world has been going to shit, and you cannot change my mind that's not these dumb liberals"". That's just one example. He's had similar outbursts on topics ranging from Roe vs Wade, poverty, women's rights, problems with police and violence in our community, etc. I wanted to go look at a car in the city and asked if he wanted to tag along, He told me I would be cutting my life short by going to that town, as it's crime infested and I'd most likely get shot. (I live in that city).  


He recently opened up to me and told me that he's been pretty lonely, and the dating apps aren't doing it for him. He's tried to approach girls before but he gets shut down/ghosted on a frequent occasion. He asked if I had any friends I could set him up with, as I'm a fairly big extrovert.  
I just told him I didn't know of anyone that would vibe with him super well, which wasn't a complete lie.   


Many of our mutual friends have started uninviting him to certain events, as his overall demeanor isn't very enjoyable to be around. I don't know if I should have a heart to heart with him and tell him that these views that he's adopted making him very unattractive to most people in our field and friend group.

From social media posts I’ve seen shared it seems there are many women who are into the 2A open carry gun crazy culture that exists in the US, why aren’t there more females that commit gun crimes? Is it related somehow to the psychological differences in men vs. women?",NoStupidQuestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2991291d0>,1617195703.0,">Shooting into a room full of innocent people as they cower in fear ""is very sadistic,"" O'Toole said. ""And sadistic violence like this is almost exclusively male."" 

>Most men, of course, go through life without killing anyone. And motives for crime are very individual; not all women and men who kill do so for the same reasons. Each case is unique, experts stress. But something in the combination of male biology and socialization makes men more prone to violence. Notably, the gender gap in violence is found in almost every culture around the world, Garbarino said.

>**There are no simple answers. The easiest theory to digest is probably an evolutionary one: Males, over hundreds of thousands of years of development, have historically been rewarded for aggression.** A tendency toward violence is seen in chimpanzees, humans' closest living primate relative. (Bonobos, humanity's other close primate family member, are far more peaceful, though recent research has shown they are drawn to jerks.) Violence can beget status for males, both in chimps and in humans (just look at how many action heroes get the girl). And for males, a lack of status can mean missing out on the chance to mate.

>Indeed, sexual frustration is a theme running through the writings of many male mass shooters, Lankford said. Many shooters leave manifestos explicitly detailing their hatred of women and of men who seemed to navigate relationships with women with ease.

>""By contrast, I'm not aware of any female attackers, even though we have a small sample, I don't know that any of them complained about not being able to have sex,"" Lankford said.    

>Status plays a large role in school shootings, a particularly male phenomenon, said Katherine Newman, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Newman, author of ""Rampage: The Social Roots of School Shootings"" (Basic Books, 2005), argues that there has never been a typical school shooting with a female perpetrator. A case in San Diego in 1979 involved a teenage girl who lived across from an elementary school and started shooting children and staff from her home one morning. But in cases of random shootings on school grounds by a person who is part of that school's community, the perpetrators are all male, Newman told Live Science.

>These boys and young men may be responding to a cultural script that equates violence with masculinity, Newman said. Most are not loners. Instead, they try to join social groups but struggle. Their experience is one of disappointment and humiliation. So, they decide to trade in their ""loser"" persona for something more appealing, according to Newman.

>""Sadly for all of us, that something more appealing is the role of the antihero,"" Newman said.

>Girls aren't similarly targeted with the notion that becoming a violent antihero is appealing, Newman said. Their reputational struggles play out in other ways, usually involving self-harm or nasty gossip.

>The gap in aggression between girls and boys has narrowed, though, said Garbarino, author of ""See Jane Hit: Why Girls Are Growing More Violent and What We Can Do About It"" (The Penguin Press HC, 2006). More popular media show girls and women acting in violent ways, which provides role models for female aggression, he said.

>Still, the gender gap in lethal violence hasn't shrunk like the gap in general violence, Garbarino said. It's a mystery as to why. Men may be biologically vulnerable: Variations in a gene called MAOA combined with early developmental stressors like abuse or drug use can raise a man's risk of criminality. Men are also more likely than women to base moral decisions on abstract principles rather than on empathy, Garbarino said.

He wanted a new term to help the black/African-American community to recapture their racial heritage.  The term has since become so ingrained in American discourse that we started to use the ""X - American"" construct for other ethnicities as well, but like Jesse Jackson it is usually because we feel an existing term has too many bad connotations.

Scientology is absolutely a destructive Cult. Thank you all for helping me see that.

I saw that post the other day about the person who found out they were dating a Scientologist. All the comments said it was a dangerous cult and that it ruined people's lives and destroyed families. That was the first time I really read anything about Scientology on the internet. I've avoided looking at anything online because I've been afraid to accidentally see the confidential stuff and my parents told me that if I saw it before I was ready I could go type III or die. But after reading some of those comments... well they can't all be lying right?

I'm too scared to go looking for myself because I dont want to see anything about the OT levels. But I'm starting to think Scientology may be a cult. My parents have gone broke donating money to Scientology. I've had to disconnect from my friends because they were declared SPs. Although I've had a lot of wins in Auditing personally there has also been a lot of bad stuff that I just kind of ignore because I like getting Auditing.

Am I in a cult?

Edit: thank you to everyone who's commented. You have all been so kind and understanding. The few things that I've looked at as recommend by comments have already blown my mind. Scientology is undeniably a cult. Although I cannot deny that its helped me in various ways its honestly done more harm to my family than good. My parents have worked so hard there entire lives and they have nothing to show for it because Scientology has taken everything. It may take me a long time to come to terms with all of this and I may lose everyone I care about over it. But I'd still rather live a disappointing truth than a total lie. Thank you.

But I don’t know a single person who isn’t aware that it’s pretty shitty over there. It’s a dictatorship, and it’s scary and horrible for the civilians over there.

About an hour ago, I delivered a cash order of a single sandwich (the entire order came to be about $12 including tax and delivery fee) to an apartment, and an adult man with Down's syndrome answered the door. He handed me a bill that was folded into an origami crane. When I unfolded it (back in my car), it turned out to be an $100 bill.

Now my anxiety is through the roof because I'm afraid that the man may not have known the value of the bill and that by accepting it, I would be taking advantage of him. 

My friend said that he probably knew the value and just wanted to give me an $80+ tip, but even that feels wrong to accept... am I just overthinking the entire situation?

385,There’s a woman outside of my house who’s been there for about an hour. She keeps knocking and ringing the bell which sends my dog crazy. I’m 16M home alone and she won’t leave. More below.,"My family is at a party and this woman won’t leave. She keeps saying “hello”. She wont leave and keeps knocking frantically. It’s Been at least 45 minutes. What do I do? I’ve barricaded myself in a room with a lock and lacrosse stick.

About an hour and 15 minutes ago I got a call from an unknown number and it was some guy with an Indian accent whispering about if I’ve “gotten my package”. My dog is freaking out to. 

How do I get out of this situation?

EVERYONE THE SITUATION IS ALL TAKEN CARE OF—

She left eventually and I’m ok. If you want the full story it’s in the comments.

UPDATE- Situation is solved. It was a neighbor or something who thought we had her package. Doesn’t really explain why she was there for over an hour and consistently knocking/ringing doorbell/trying to talk but idc. Anyways, thanks for the suggestions and help, I’m ok.

More backstory i guess—

She ordered a laptop when she was on vacation in Europe to our house and told my parents. So that we could like hold on to it when she’s gone so it doesn’t get stolen. She came over tonight and tried to get it from us between 8-10:30 pm without telling my family at all that she was coming. Anyways my family left for a party so I was home alone which leads me back to the original post and all that happened there. For those of you wondering why I didn’t contact my parents, I did. It was one of the first things I did after heading upstairs and barricading myself in with a lacrosse stick. If you don’t know much about lacrosse it hurts a lot to get hit with pads on so I assumed it must really hurt without them. They checked the cameras and couldn’t really see much other than that there was a woman. That’s why I didn’t go to the door. Eventually they tried talking to her through the cameras and it worked. If you’re wondering why she did it or something, we don’t know but we think they have a mental illness or something. Also, with the phone call, I have no idea what that is. I did order some DoorDash tacos that arrived about 20 minutes before the call. But they were delivered by “Amy” and not some middle aged sounding Indian guy. Anyways the guy was whispering and like “did you get your package… did you get your delivery”. And then I asked what he meant and he just said “your package” so I just hung up on the guy. Also I’ve never gotten a call after getting DoorDash delivered. Honestly, it’s probably not connected and I likely won’t learn what was up with that call.

I also was hesitant to communicate with her because my house is in an affluent area above the main part of my city and lots of people (mainly homeless and stuff because my city has an extreme homeless problem) try to come up here and get lucky through things like searching through trash cans, breaking into cars, robbing homes etc. I didn’t want to risk anything like that so I decided staying out was the best option and I had the lacrosse stick if I really needed it.

The neighbors behind me claimed to receive my DoorDash order. I don’t know anything about if they actually got a copy of it or something or if it wasn’t actually for me. I mean I could’ve gotten 2 orders of tacos… 

But anyways, The situation is fixed. The woman went back to her house (laptop-less) and I’m currently laying on the couch responding to all of the comments. Thanks everyone for your help and insightful comments.

I survived the night as well 💪🏼💪🏼

People had their groups of friends, but it wasn’t such a stark contrast in personalities.  People tend to mingle outside of their “groups”.

For example, if you watch Netflix, you may or may not notice if the quality is a little less than normal.  You might think you just have a bad connection and go on with your viewing.  But if you really looked into it and decided to route your internet through a VPN, you might suddenly realize that your quality has gone up dramatically.  Your provider may have slowed down traffic from that site without you knowing.

This example isn't what could happen, but what has happened in the past.

It's the more explicit instructions, commentary, customs/traditions/rituals, and foundational texts that create the actual practice of a religion. Mythology is made up of cultural stories and can be stories related to a religion but it's going to be written in narrative format which is distinct from informative and critical texts.  There absolutely is Christian and Jewish and Islamic and Hindu and Buddhist and so on and so forth mythology, there are classifications for mythologies from all currently practiced religions as well as classifications for the separate religious texts in modern library systems and that's also true for religions that are no longer practiced.

I realize this isn't exactly an anthropology answer but the ways we organize knowledge in a culture both inform how we talk about those things and is informed by how people were already talking about them when those categories were created. I don't know the exact history of it but I do know that separating those two sides of the religion coin is a thing humans have been doing for a long time at least in modern nations impacted by US library standards bc the knowledge organization systems we currently use are very old. And so, since someone searching for mythology texts would have to go to a different section than when searching for religious texts talking about it as though they're distinct from each other becomes a kind of normal or common.

Maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep.

Working, trying to exercise, trying to have time for my dog, trying to have a social life, trying to keep up with family, trying to find a date lol all sorts of stuff.

During all that time of stress though I was neglecting myself.  I spent so much time trying to do other things that I didn't really even know who I was... if that makes sense.

During this isolation I have been able to really look introspectively as to who I am as a person 

I have determined that I am a good son to my parents. A good brother to my siblings. An awesome uncle. A good friend.. I look at my dog and I can see the love she has for more me. I've determined that as a whole I am a good person.

I have realized that I can comfortable with who I am. Before I was always trying to fit in with all sorts of things. Now I know more of what my direction and ideals/beliefs, and Interests are.

I was able to indulge in some nostalgia and play some games ive all but forgotten and never really had time to finish. I even busted out the GameCube and nintendo 64, xbox 360 and just indulged in some things I loved from childhood. I even found that peoppe were still even playing Halo 3 and Halo reach online! I had a blast 

I have majorly gotten myself into cooking. Before my meals basically consisted of food from places like chipotle, noodles and company, etc. Now I've realized that when I put my mind to it, homemade food can be fucking delicious. I even plan meals throughout the week based on what ingredients I have!

I have read a lot more. Before I'd be hard pressed to read 1 book a year. I've already read 5 in 2 months.

Most noticeably I've felt less stress about money. I'm getting my normal pay from unemployment, but I'm missing out in spending all that extra money on material good or going out to eat.

I've finally been able to set myself up financially. I'm always i month of rent ahead and I have also been able to put a few thousand dollars into investments. 


I also feel less stress having to hang out with friends. Before i always wouldn't feel very psyched to hang out with friends because I was so tired. Now I dont have to worry about being tired. Plus my friends and I just chat over the phone. So im.still keeping up without having to maintain a physical presence 

I've realized I actually hate my job and am shifting my goals elsewhere.

Idk i mean obviously I haven't been this happy the whole time. But once I realized more and more that this is the new normal for a while it kinda shifted me on from stressing out about the virus, to redirecting me in a different direction in life and making me realize the positives I have to offer as well as the negatives and how I can turn those negatives to positives.

Sorry if this was a long read, it just felt really good putting my thoughts into words

**Quick edit: Wow! Wasn't expecting my 1AM word vomit to get so much attention**

For those of you who are struggling (which simply based off of comments on this post) I know is the majority, I have a favor to ask of you.

Today, I want you to just turn your phone off, turn notifications off and shut that part of your life off. Phones these days are just the harbinger of negative news. Constant Flashing headlines and beeps of negativity. When you are already in a down mindset, having negative things constantly getting shoved in your face is not going to help.

If you are able, just remove yourself from your phone and get nice and comfortable on a couch or a bed with a cup of tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc and watch your favorite movie, play your favorite game, or read a book. Remove that negativity and instead replace it with something positive that you know you enjoy. Even if its just for a day, having nothing but positives and relaxation will do wonders for your health. 

For those who are struggling with loved ones who have COVID,  I am so sorry you are going through this right now. I know hopes and prayers are a dumb thing, but given that I'm just a random stranger on reddit, that's all I can give. I will hope and pray that your loved ones make it through.

If any of you are in an abusive relationship be it family, or a significant other, please understand that you are worth more than that. For some of you I know it is not easy or maybe not even possible to escape that situation right now. But you are worth more than the abuse, be it physiological, mental, or physical. If you are in need of help, use the site below.

If you have someone who monitors your phone, use incognito mode so it won't show up on search histories.

There’s this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she’s looking through my social media profiles, won’t stop snapping me or Facebooking me, I’ve since deleted her Snapchat and blocked her on Facebook. 

Anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. I moved my arm away to which she responded “don’t you like to be touched?” to which I responded “not by you”. So she went to kick me in the balls but I moved out of the way and said “no chance”. 

As we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. She moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which I pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. She said “I’m only joking” before trying to do it again IN FUCKING PLAIN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. All the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. The manager wasn’t present during this.

Anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said “dude, isn’t that basically sexual assault?” I responded “is it?” He said “man, she literally molested you and tried again” 

Honestly, I don’t know what to think. I am contemplating telling the manager but I feel she’ll laugh it off and class it as a joke because I’m a man.

When I lived closer to a lot of oil refineries, the air would sometimes have a petroleum smell at night. 

I believe the reason is that when the atmosphere cools at night air higher above ground cools faster and sinks and brings what’s actually pollution down to the ground level. Smoke in the summer and fall. Ozone in the winter. Whatever else is in the air.

503,Do male prison guards at female prisons get verbally harrassed with sexual crap like female guards at male prisons do?,,questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2a9416b90>,1694820360.0,"I did my college internship at a womans prison. The people who work there gossip just like any other job. From that gossip, I know there was a man who worked there who slept with several prisoners before he got caught and fired. 

The ladies had inmate girlfriends. Some were ""gay for the stay"". That said, women overtly talking to the prison guards in sexualized ways would have resulted in disciplinary action. I never saw it happen.

The women's prison was much stricter because women tend to be easier to control (statistically, I am a woman, don't come at me). 

For instance the prison I worked at didn't have a fence because the community didn't see the women as a threat and were worried about their property values so the kept blocking it through legal channels. 

The prison is legit across the street from an elementary school. Unreal.

In ten years they had one woman escape because something horrible was happening with their kids. 

Compare that to the men's prison where in the six months it took to do my internship a gun, a sword, and a dug out tunnel to try to escape were found by guards. The rules at that prison were much more lax because the guards are too busy trying to deal with real daily violence to write some dude up for wolf whistling at a gaurd.

Hope that makes sense.",5

After graduating, I found I loved programming, too, and decided to do that for a living. Now that I’m much older, I feel I would have enjoyed forensics. As most people age, they discover new passions. Who knows - you may decide neurology interests you a decade from now.

Say a game gets a shitload of downloads and makes $260k total. Every download past that 200k mark gets a $0.20 charge to the developers. If the game is a low cost or free game, the devs may end up owing Unity more than they ever made.

I met a Proud Rapist when I worked as a temp in college, it was jarring. Strange guy, scary looking and had a bunch of Marine Corp tattoos that had been blacked out.

I reported him to out supervisor who was a former 1st Sgt in the army and he confronted him. The rapist guy starts to try “explain” what he meant, literally still defending the fact Rape was good and that’s what required of anybody whose going to defend his country , the 1st Sgt grabbed him by the collar and threw him out the  bay doors and fired him on the spot. As it turned out he was sent to prison and dishonorably discharged for Rape, and I’m guessing while in military prison the Marines did not take kindly to him having Marine Corp tats and gave him a cover up.

Does that seem weird to anyone else?,questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2ab7a9490>,1694533387.0,">Does that seem weird to anyone else?

its not that weird. Energy is important, REALLY important. We need it to do literally anything. 

Oil won't last forever, and its clearly not good for us health wise, and not good for us climate wise, so oil is on borrowed time.

The future was always going to be electric. Oil is not that efficient, we waste a lot of its energy as heat. 

All America is doing is what it has always done, maintain power by controlling energy. 

We basically only use oil because its really easy to store and its fairly energy dense for its weight. 

Batteries still have a ways to go, but once batteries are good enough to more energy dense than oil, you will see oil disappear very fast.",2

A car hydroplaned onto incoming traffic on the interstate and got T-boned. The driver was a young woman and the passenger was a young man probably early twenties. The crash had caused the driver to fall into the passenger’s lap. When he woke up he panicked and started flailing his extremities and yelling get it off me. Not knowing it was the young woman. We pulled her off of him and stabilized him first. She had obvious signs of internal trauma to her abdomen and what appeared to be a broken neck. I still stabilized her as the firefighters removed the top of the car to extract them. When they were cutting through the windshield shards of glass started falling into her eyes. That sight stuck with me for a long time. I covered her head as quickly as possible to keep the debris off of her. She was very beautiful and frail. After the passenger was extracted we began CPR on her but she had gone. Her face and the glistening eyes are burned into my memory.,3

Toxic masculinity is any conception of ""manhood"" that causes the one who believes in it to limit themselves into the name of preserving the concept.   

If you want to play games with babies, but you don't let yourself because it feels unmanly, that's toxic masculinity.   

If you want to dance to Taylor Swift in public, but you hold yourself back to preserve an image of manliness, that's toxic masculinity.   

If you legitimately don't give a shit about some randos opinion of you, but still feel compelled to fight them for any random slight.  That's toxic masculinity.  




It's the thing inside that tries to shame you for being you in a way that doesn't conform to a narrow interpretation of what men are allowed to be.

It's weird that it's half a cat, relatively unscathed. I don't expect that from a coyote but I could see that from an owl eating the cat from the back and eventually the front dropped out of the tree.

this isn't masculine or feminine, but doing skincare can also make you more feel confident. doing gua sha, moisturizing, or even getting a face cleanser can make you feel more clean and make your complexion look and feel better.

this one is much easier said than done, but really just don't worry about what other people think. a lot of times, people are more worried about themselves than other people, and if they are worried about you (for the wrong reasons), then they arent worth your time. if you think someone is only friends with you to make them look better, I would either talk with them, or stop being friends with them (again easier said than done)

About parents. Sometimes they feel like if you have any issues it reflects poorly on them or their parenting so they deny any “problems“ their children may have. They grew up in judgement that mental or emotional distress is willful rather than involuntary. As a result they put this judgment on others. 

I don’t know where you are. If you are in the US and in school, you might consider talking to a counselor about your concerns especially as it relates to your inability to focus and study. You can be tested and referred often at no cost.

In some US states you can access therapy for mental health as young as 14 without your parents consent.

826,What is a reasonable price for outside storage of a snowmobile?,"A guy who was working for our small business basically ghosted us (after asking for a cash advance from my husband which he was given). He never actually quit just had some probable lie one night about not being able to work the next day then never responded again. A mutual friend told us he claimed he broke the phone we were paying for and we haven’t heard from him in months. His snowmobile has been at our house since the winter. He can have it back when he pays for storing it, I’m just not sure what is a reasonable price as we wouldn’t have charged him if this hasn’t happened.",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2acc3cf90>,1694238350.0,"# Message to all users:

This makes writing poetry very easy, as the imagery comes almost instantaneously. Just wondered if others also do this? Is this common and is there a term for this",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2afba2d10>,1694867501.0,"# Message to all users:

968,Do male prison guards at female prisons get verbally harrassed with sexual crap like female guards at male prisons do?,,questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2afad3c10>,1694820360.0,"I did my college internship at a womans prison. The people who work there gossip just like any other job. From that gossip, I know there was a man who worked there who slept with several prisoners before he got caught and fired. 

The ladies had inmate girlfriends. Some were ""gay for the stay"". That said, women overtly talking to the prison guards in sexualized ways would have resulted in disciplinary action. I never saw it happen.

The women's prison was much stricter because women tend to be easier to control (statistically, I am a woman, don't come at me). 

For instance the prison I worked at didn't have a fence because the community didn't see the women as a threat and were worried about their property values so the kept blocking it through legal channels. 

The prison is legit across the street from an elementary school. Unreal.

In ten years they had one woman escape because something horrible was happening with their kids. 

Compare that to the men's prison where in the six months it took to do my internship a gun, a sword, and a dug out tunnel to try to escape were found by guards. The rules at that prison were much more lax because the guards are too busy trying to deal with real daily violence to write some dude up for wolf whistling at a gaurd.

972,Home owners insurance?,We have a truck parked on compacted AB gravel in our front yard where we never had grass only dry hard dirt.

974,My landlord comes over all the time and wants to do repairs on the house is this normal ?,"My landlord is nice, but she wants to come over at least once a month or more to either paint, do the lawn, make a repair, ect. If the lawn is too long, she will text me and tell me to mow it by a certain time. Or text me and tell me to water the garden or whatever. I pay $1800 rent early every month and never miss it.

979,Why does the air outside smell so good at night?,Like the smell has a little smokey smell to it too. The reason why I love going for night walks is because of the smell of the air at night. It's so fresh and just a delight to breath.,questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2afc3ea50>,1694806988.0,"I guess it depends where you are. I’m in the northeast United States and the air often smells like a campfire in the summer and fall. In the winter  it almost smells electrified (ionized). When I lived closer to a lot of oil refineries, the air would sometimes have a petroleum smell at night. 

I believe the reason is that when the atmosphere cools at night air higher above ground cools faster and sinks and brings what’s actually pollution down to the ground level. Smoke in the summer and fall. Ozone in the winter. Whatever else is in the air. 

If you read Dickens or other 19th century literature, the characters talk almost fearfully of the night air. That’s because the coal smoke from all of the fireplaces, trains and other boilers would descend into the streets and cause respiratory issues for a lot of people.",2

Would you pay it down to their family and explain he/she loaned you $x,xxx and you’re returning it since you have it all? 
Donate a little to the funeral expenses and ease your guilt that way?
Pay it back if and only if the family asks; if not you pocket the free money or item?

TIA for reading this.",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2afc448d0>,1694802412.0,"Wow 😳 this might be a little tricky but basically if they need the money pay it back.
If they look like they can afford it let them know you borrowed some money and you want to pay it back they might say it's okay not to. 
Me personally I would pay it back (if you can physically do that that is) my conscious wouldn't let me rest

First the company says they can't verify where I work right now. So I send a paystub. Now it's all my past employment. I have to dig for W2s and documents.

Can someone bring some light for me on this matter? ,questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b0be1a10>,1694689346.0,"Unity has stated they’re now going to be charging game developers 20 cents for every purchase after 200k downloads/profit

This is a huge issue as many of these games are indie dev (not backed by huge companies like blizzard), and will not be able to afford that. Most of these games are also free/very cheap and rely heavily on in app purchases to make revenue

Say a game gets a shitload of downloads and makes $260k total. Every download past that 200k mark gets a $0.20 charge to the developers. If the game is a low cost or free game, the devs may end up owing Unity more than they ever made.

A shotgun for home defense, a pistol for carry defense, a hunting shotgun for birds (longer barrel) a rifle for deer long range, a rifle for in wooded areas (shorter barrel), a target gun that shoots cheap ammo to keep you accurate so when you go hunting you don’t mame a animal, maybe you have a carry pistol for big game/predators that is overkill for daily carry, maybe you like just shooting shit because you can so you want a fun gun you can make a day of.. There are a thousand reason to own multiple guns, do you NEED that many….. Probably not but it’s nice to have choices, it’s like having a video game console do you need all the extra games, no but people like having choices.

32 and 17 rubs me the wrong way for sure. They are at two completely different stages of life. Why would a fully grown adult be interested in a minor anyway?",67
1104,Can you say you made something if you had a lot of help?,"I have a strange thing where I don't ever want to ask anyone for help. I find myself working on projects of my own and learning how to do every step as I want to be able to say that I made it. 

I think mostly it's a psychological thing where I was expected to do a lot as a kid. 

What are your thoughts on asking for help, and if you've received the help, do you feel you can claim the success. Even giving credit to those that helped.

1121,What's the reason behind the name of the TV series 'Diff'rent Strokes'?,"Ive watched the show as a kid and still do sometimes but Ive never thought about its name so I couldnt answer this question

  
""Diff'rent Strokes"" was a popular television series that aired from 1978 to 1986. It followed the lives of two brothers, Arnold and Willis Jackson, who were adopted by a wealthy New Yorker named Mr. Drummond. Now, let's explore the origin of the show's name: What is the origin and significance of the title 'Diff'rent Strokes' and how does it relate to the show's themes and characters?""",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b13d8810>,1694557769.0,"There was a saying that went ""different strokes for different folks"". I assume because Mr Drummond was rich and white and the 2 brothers were poor and black, they were considered ""different folks"" in relation to each other.

I reported him to out supervisor who was a former 1st Sgt in the army and he confronted him. The rapist guy starts to try “explain” what he meant, literally still defending the fact Rape was good and that’s what required of anybody whose going to defend his country , the 1st Sgt grabbed him by the collar and threw him out the  bay doors and fired him on the spot. As it turned out he was sent to prison and dishonorably discharged for Rape, and I’m guessing while in military prison the Marines did not take kindly to him having Marine Corp tats and gave him a cover up.

1135,Gas to electric? Oil to lithium?,I’m not trying to sound crazy or like a lunatic but I just thought about something.. why is it America has made it a priority to have control of oil the whole time oil has been the main needed resource for transportation and then all of a sudden when we’re getting ready to make a switch to electric vehicles they just happen to find the worlds largest lithium cache out of nowhere? Does that seem weird to anyone else?,questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b170ba90>,1694533387.0,">Does that seem weird to anyone else?

its not that weird. Energy is important, REALLY important. We need it to do literally anything. 

Oil won't last forever, and its clearly not good for us health wise, and not good for us climate wise, so oil is on borrowed time.

The future was always going to be electric. Oil is not that efficient, we waste a lot of its energy as heat. 

All America is doing is what it has always done, maintain power by controlling energy. 

We basically only use oil because its really easy to store and its fairly energy dense for its weight. 

Batteries still have a ways to go, but once batteries are good enough to more energy dense than oil, you will see oil disappear very fast.",2

The crash had caused the driver to fall into the passenger’s lap. When he woke up he panicked and started flailing his extremities and yelling get it off me. Not knowing it was the young woman. We pulled her off of him and stabilized him first. She had obvious signs of internal trauma to her abdomen and what appeared to be a broken neck. I still stabilized her as the firefighters removed the top of the car to extract them. When they were cutting through the windshield shards of glass started falling into her eyes.

Toxic masculinity is any conception of ""manhood"" that causes the one who believes in it to limit themselves into the name of preserving the concept.   

If you want to play games with babies, but you don't let yourself because it feels unmanly, that's toxic masculinity.   

If you want to dance to Taylor Swift in public, but you hold yourself back to preserve an image of manliness, that's toxic masculinity.   

If you legitimately don't give a shit about some randos opinion of you, but still feel compelled to fight them for any random slight.  That's toxic masculinity.

1237,How to be more confident?,I have an issue with seeing myself within friend groups and just around talking to people in general mainly because I wasn’t “good looking” enough and always concurred the ugly person people can rely on to make themselves look better and I don’t know how to recover from that now that I’m trying to build myself as a person I don’t know what to do I’m stumped,questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b3347650>,1694320289.0,"im not sure what gender you are or what you're comfortable with, but if you like to be more feminine, I suggest doing makeup. it really makes me feel more confident, and I don't even really do much I just do mascara, eyeliner, and lipgloss. its also a pretty fun thing to do

this isn't masculine or feminine, but doing skincare can also make you more feel confident. doing gua sha, moisturizing, or even getting a face cleanser can make you feel more clean and make your complexion look and feel better.

this one is much easier said than done, but really just don't worry about what other people think. a lot of times, people are more worried about themselves than other people, and if they are worried about you (for the wrong reasons), then they arent worth your time. if you think someone is only friends with you to make them look better, I would either talk with them, or stop being friends with them (again easier said than done)

smiling more can make you more confident, too. it also shows your comfortable, and generally smiling makes people happier and also find you more attractive (not necessarily romantically).",2
1238,Is there a reddit that could help?,"Okay so I (17F) have always struggled with organization, concentration,.. and so on.

This time I made more research and I was like wth?! 

I told my parents but they simply denied and said that people with adhd have wayy more energy than I do.

I'll for sure go see a professional when I'm older but for now I have no clue what to do.

Is there a reddit for like tips or even a partial diagnosis??",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b3335510>,1694319704.0,"It’s okay. There are online quizzes that give you information that you can use in discussing this with your doctor (or even your parents).

About parents. Sometimes they feel like if you have any issues it reflects poorly on them or their parenting so they deny any “problems“ their children may have. They grew up in judgement that mental or emotional distress is willful rather than involuntary. As a result they put this judgment on others. 

I don’t know where you are. If you are in the US and in school, you might consider talking to a counselor about your concerns especially as it relates to your inability to focus and study. You can be tested and referred often at no cost.

In some US states you can access therapy for mental health as young as 14 without your parents consent. 

I just realized at 68 years old that I have ADHD. It has affected me all of my life. My sister was diagnosed as an adult but I didn’t think it was my issue because she’s so fidgety and I’m not. I just have severe difficulties concentrating especially on my studies. I have two Master’s Degrees but my grades and understanding could have been much better if I had realized and been treated for it.

1388,Why is it that only white people get called out as racist?," I am mixed ( mom (W), dad (B) ) and all I ever hear is about white people hating other races. I don't believe  that any one race is without racists because 1. No race is totally accepting of all other races. 2. We rarely know how to act towards races that are not in our families. ( we can learn what not to do but we still don't know truly why the wrong act or word causes a problem, only that it does) 

For example: I walk into a store own by an Asian man or woman, I am being watched like a hawk and followed from isle to isle. Why? ""Because black people steal!"" Now that's not true of us all but there is an amount of us, who are so narcissistic that they feel they are entitled to take whatever they want.

I am followed because some other black people are ""F""ing stupid but I have to live with the results of the ignorant few caused. So ignorant give the other races reason to fear and mistrust us.",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2b9d00750>,1598572557.0,"Im black, and im going to keep it straight foward and put it as simple as possible. If you hate someone or show some form of animosity towards someone because of their race, no matter what race or skin color you are it's racist. Yes black people can be racist, yes white people can be racist. Anyone can be racist. That's the real truth. If we weren't so divided by colors and all this other crap we'd realize that its really only one race which is the human race. We all look diffrent due to being from diffrent enviroments and apart of the world but we are same race. If you take a certain animal and have it breed on the opposite side of the world its originally from, the generations to come are most likely going to change to adapt to the new enviroment. The fur may change color, get thicker or thinner etc. It's still the same animal just diffrent. But people (on all sides) are divided because in the world we live in right now everyone wants to be better than the other. It's not even really a race thing anymore it's more so about being on the top. Hopefully things will change eventually. And we can all just be ""humans"" peacefully together. Doubtful but hopefully",32

Way way back during the hunter gatherer days, it wasn’t uncommon for separate  human groups to fight over territory, food, etc. they would often even take members of the other group as prisoners. In order to survive, these abductees would develop what we now know to be Stockholm syndrome. The less resistant they were to their new group, the more likely they’d survive. Dogs and other pets don’t develop this because they didn’t evolve to. In fact many animals, especially dogs, have evolved alongside humans. So for that reason they actually survive better when their living in a home with humans. Also a lot of animals don’t have the mental capability to comprehend the idea of being a “prisoner” like small rodents and reptiles. As long as they’re fed and properly housed and cared for, they really don’t give a fuck.",28

1472,Why do people hate victims of abusive Autistic people?,"I was 6 years old placed in special ed. A boy kept hitting me, when I cried the tea hers told me he can't help it and they couldn't stop him.

When I was a teenager I went to a Autism dance, a Autistic man twice my size nearly punched me. And by nearly, he would've if I didn't grow up watching TMNT and learning to roll and dodge.

When I speak of my story, I get called names. Ableist, garbage. I am told I am a liar. I left a psychiatrist who labeled me Autistic, and am fearful of finding another one because I usually am ignored, invalidated. Told it's a spectrum, as if this were to justify putting violent people around others. When I speak online about this I am silenced.

There are children who are forced to go to special ed with students so violent they need to evacuate the class if they become agitated. Why do we force children to endure what many adults cannot? Gaslighting their innocent minds, convincing them they're playing the victim. While the violent students go unpunished.

What are people like me supposed to do? We're convinced we're monsters for having survival instincts. We're put back in with the people who abused us if we seek help. All while being lied to that violent Autistic people don't exist.

What would you tell your child convinced they're a bully because they cried, cowered, begged not to be hit? What would you say as they cry in terror of going back to school, having been made a target of a Autistic bully? And how would you feel when the school tells you they can't do anything, their abuser is trying so hard to not be a sociopath. You don't understand how much the child torturing your child day after day, smiling as they cry, suffers. That happened to my mom.

And now kids are dying everywhere because the US believes it's not child abuse to put children in with other children that prey upon them. Children told they're a bully for not letting the Autistic student treat them as an object, their toy. They cannot appreciate the feelings of others, and so they use and abuse.

Not all Autistic people. But the community does a great job of minimizing and hiding those among them who are predatory. Adam Lanza, Elliot Rodgers. You cannot say treat me normally, but don't acknowledge just like neurotypicals we're not all angels.

So it continues. A gay special needs boy ends his life, because his peers can't help calling him slurs. Another school of children die at the hands of a gunman. All so special ed teachers can attempt to teach a sociopath how to be a human being.

They cry discrimination and stigma. Everyone comes running to defend them from reality. People like me, we risk losing relationships if we speak out. We are blamed and shamed, emotionally abused into silence. We face stigma, we are called uncaring monsters. All because we didn't want to be hit. All because we don't want other children to suffer as we have.

It's okay to hate people like me, who only made the mistake of having been born in a time of inclusion at the expense of children's lives. Why is that? Why would anyone beat up on someone who's abuser according to the world does not exist, like the Invisible Man movie? Who would convince a 6 year old child you are no different than the students who eat you alive?

When will we stop blaming the victims, and realize that treating Autism as a badge of immunity against consequence is killing kids?",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2bbd86d10>,1583344291.0,This is a good post i don't know what to write but here's a medal ✌,16

1500,Is being attractive all that matters if you’re female,"  Recently I’ve felt overwhelmed with feeling like there’s no point in my existence because I’m not attractive. It feels like men simply have no interest in women who aren’t conventionally attractive and that I have no value to society. Is that true more or less? It feels that way. Everything I see on media and social media seems to indicate that I’m not really female and not worthy of any notoriety whatsoever unless I look hot. I’d rather be valued on my intelligence but that only appears to backfire in relationships with men in my experience. I’d like to be valued for my personality and skills and for the things I’m good at but again, none of that seems to count. Can men love a woman who isn’t beautiful? Will they want to be with me after my body changes with aging and children?

Guys don't love the hot ones either. Typically, we use them to make ourselves feel better about ourselves. We're a bit too dumb to recognize that, so we'll never admit it, but that's the truth behind the curtain.

That's what you're missing out on, being used.

Learn to absolutely love yourself. You'll be spending an awful lot of time with yourself, you might as well make it enjoyable. Build a life that is yours outside of a relationship, so that when an opportunity comes along you know exactly what you're sacrificing to be with him. 

You are enough, regardless of how you look. Fight for yourself, and be kind to yourself while you do it. I *promise* all you're missing out on is disappointment",36

I have the right to say he was a shitty math teacher because I scored 100% on all the assignments in the unit we’re on.

The study guide he gave us only helped us prepare for 1/3rd of what was actually on the quiz. If I had to guess, he just wanted to finish the unit and move on to the next so he gave us a quiz with questions he never helped us with. Now my A will probably drop to a B and that pisses me the fuck off. How are teachers allowed to skip through important lessons and suddenly decide to give us a test worth the majority of your grade? 

It’s like math teachers expect you to study for things they never mentioned, and find out yourself how to solve something. My science teacher gave way more work than my math teacher and they still gave thorough, easy to understand, explanations on what to do and how to do it.

I think higher math is just difficult and lower math usually just comes to people who are good at it, so because they've never had to really explain it, they're bad at teaching it. Makes perfect sense to them, but it's hard getting other people to understand immediately.  I've had teachers like that who would teach us A, but then a problem on the test required A B and C.

1520,Why do I only fall in love with fictional characters?,"Hey, first of I'm very sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for a question like this. I don't really know where else to ask and the whole thing just makes me crazy... If it's wrong I would appreciate it if you could direkt me to a more fitting place...

I never talked about this with anyone and write that pretty impulsively so please have patience...

So here we go: I never really fallen in love with anyone real. Which isn't a problem in of itself, I always had the theory that I might be asexual, but what's throwing that theory out the window is: that I always seem to get crushes/ fall in love with fictional characters. And it's not like it was my whole life like that. Childhood: never interested in anyone. Now ( 22, so technically way to old for this): let's just think about this stupid character the whole day, and get sad because you know he doesn't exist. I already know that I get attached to things way to quickly and I tried things like ""just stay away from the certain media the character is from"", but it doesn't work. There comes always a new one. I'm aware of the ""fangirling"" stuff, but I think it's not (just) that because it's really affecting my day to day life. Sometimes getting me to a really depressed point with certain dark thoughts I probably shouldn't talk about...

And at the end, I love reading, watching series and playing video games... I can't just stop everything that has fictional characters in it, because my stupid brain won't realize that that's not how it works... A life full of ""I'ma stare at this wall"" doesn't sound like a better solution.

I don't really know what's wrong with me. I just want to know if anyone has experience with this? Or maybe a few tips? Or literally anything that could help?

And again I apologize if I posted this wrong... I really didn't want to bother anyone.

1523,I don’t get the “cops bad” movement.,"Before you downvote next, let me explain.

I fully understand the situation and injustice with george floyd and police brutality that’s been happening for decades.

I fully understand the protest and support the protests happening all around the country. 

But what I don’t understand is the hundreds of thousands of tweets, posts, and comments all over social media, (reddit and twitter especially) spreading cop hate. 

I’ve seen many comments on reddit stereotyping every cop, and “punishing” every cop solely because of the bad cops. Example:
 “Maybe we shouldn’t sell cops anything anymore: food. Clothes. Gasoline. Anything. Refuse them service. Plenty of racists will continue to feed and clothe them. But they’re not a protected class. And eventually they might have to quit their jobs to feed their families. Eat the rich. Starve the cops.
I’ve also seen countless reddit posts and comment saying all cops are “pigs, racists, and pussys”. 

Just scrolling through twitter you can find many posts and comments saying “Fuck The Police” and other hateful messages aimed at the police.

All these posts and comments have many likes and upvotes, the one I linked had over 300, when it was posted only 4 hours ago.

I get many people are mad and disgusted of what recently happened and what has been happening for decades. But please.

Explain to me like i’m five why it’s okay to profile and stereotype every single 800,000 police officers in the united states and say hateful messages to every one of them. Isn’t that the same as saying all protesters are looting and being violent? (which is false) or only black people are protesting? (again, obviously false)

Like most of the world, things aren't as stable as we would like RN. The cost of living is extremely high, even where it shouldn't be. Our schools and medical facilities are bad and seem to be getting worse. 

Also, for a country with free speech, you really have to watch what you say. While the government can't attack you for your speech, schools, corporate environments, and even home owners accociations or co-ops are mired in identity politics. You can lose a lot for saying the wrong thing, and those goal posts are always moving.

Crime and drug abuse are growing issues.


There are good things, too, though.


The USA is tremendous, and different states can feel like different nations do in Europe. Which state you choose will vastly change your experience. From people to attitudes, laws, and even the biome/nature will be vastly different from place to place. 

It takes more than 3 days, only stopping for gas to drive from east to west, and more than 24 hours from north to south. We have great roads, beautiful national parks, and just road tripping around can be an amazing experience.

The US is extremely diverse, and in most large cities, you can find a bit of home through dining and organized cultural communities.

If you're willing to work hard or are entrepreneurial, there is still a lot of opportunity to be had, and money to be made.

Most Americans are friendly people. Many people visiting the US that I speak to have the notion that it will be a violent place or that we are all shooting at each other constantly. This is surprisingly rarely the case, regardless of how our news looks. Again, the US is a massive place, and distilling down all the evil into a concentrated news cycle looks a lot worse than it is.


Overall I think its a pretty good place to live. I wouldn't choose anywhere else anyway.",43

1583,Why is Reddit so toxic?,"A little backstory why I decided to ask this: 
This is a throwaway account. I deactivated my old account due to getting tons of hate upon something that I posted on a subreddit. It didn't include me wanting to do/doing anything illegal or something that would cause harm. 
It got to the point where I was harrassed over it and it was used against me as 'valid' arguments when the argument wasn't even about that topic. It happened multiple times, not just once.


Everyone seems to act like Reddit it superior to the communities on Instagram and TikTok, when in reality they're the exact same. Maybe Reddit is even a little worse.


So my question is: Why is Reddit so toxic?



Edit: Thank you all for your answers.
If it helps anyone I got harrassed because I supported someone who is a furry by saying I'm an MLP artist myself and I draw as a stress relief and a way to vent. Apparently liking something obviously means I want to fuck it according to this hellhole of a site.

And some people don't hate, just dislike and get annoyed/irritated.

But for those who hate, it may be because of how he handled the coronavirus issue.

At first, he denied it. It was on the news that time, and on social media. 

Then, reports started rolling in about widespread infections in the country. But, he was slow to move. Countries like China(the literal epicentre of the pandemic) and South Korea were quick to move and try to stop it. For example, quarantining an entire area, like can't even travel by train outside that kind in the case of China. And this happened really quickly, so much so that China was praised for it's quick response in disaster control even when they were right smack in the  middle of the chaos.

And as a note, the US is by no means a poor country. In fact, resources available to it in terms of hospitals and finances and manpower are quite high. But response times were so slow that you had reported cases rising drastically by the day.

Not to mention the prank tweets he did which got some people harmed when they followed them. Might be partly their fault but when your country is one of the worst performers you don't want to lose their trust and think you're not taking this seriously.

He started to hoist blame on others, and say that he took it seriously from the start and all that when things got really serious. The news and social media picked up on that.

Not to mention the lack of support from the government at the local level in terms of crucial ventillators, where states were actually competing for them. Of course, due to the lack of preparations beforehand.


Might seem that he's a disappointing president, but to some, their grandparents died because of his carelessness. For some, their friends died because of him. 

This is made worse by the fact that he's a billionare. Someone who seems so far away and doesn't seem to care about them. Average people are more closely connected and relatable to average people than billionares are. Trying to explain away his mistakes may be to some as due to negligence instead of ""everybody makes mistakes"". ""He should've have helped us"" ""He's still playing around"" ""He got all this money and didn't spend a cent on us"" etc.

And, his mistakes were also present in earlier cases, such as the US-China trade war.

His character now seems to many as lousy and terrible and selfish. After all he has done, and all they have lost and suffered, some may choose to hate him. Especially with his big promises during his campaigns.


For many, he's a joke of a president. For some, he's an enemy.


I say this as an outsider, and seeing all the news reports 
about him makes him look like a joke. Worse than just shoving a random person into that position kind.

But that's just my opinion:)",45

1604,I'm 17 and I haven't talked to anyone my age in 10 months. How do I get out of this cycle of isolation?,"Hi. This will probably be a pretty long post so strap in. I'm a 17 year old guy in America. About 10 months ago girlfriend and I broke up. It all ended with her blocking me on social media and everything, pretty typical teenage dating drama. The real issue was that she was the only person I talked to at all. She was my only friend. All of my other ""friends"" were just her friends who hung around just for her. I never really felt any connection with any of them. I've pretty much always been this way. I'll have one friend, we'll drift apart, and then I'll be left isolated and depressed until I find someone else to talk to. I've never been able to comprehend how to initiate friendships, either. Someone else always has to initiate it. The thing is that pretty shortly after my girlfriend and I broke up our school shut down because of Coronavirus, and I haven't been able to meet anyone new. I quickly fell down a spiral of staying home all the time, talking only to my parents, and wallowing in my own depression. I was actually rather fine with my isolation until about four months ago, when a tree almost entirely destroyed my family's house during a hurricane. After that things just got so much worse. I eventually threatened suicide and went to a psych ward. That week and a half at the psych ward is the only time in the last 10 months that I've talked to anyone my age and I loved it. Obviously being in the psych ward itself was not a joyous time, but actually talking to people was amazing. After I came back from the hospital things just kinda got worse on the loneliness front. I guess that having a taste of human contact made me crave it even more when I no longer had it. I no longer wanted to kill myself, sure, but at this point I literally can't watch two characters on TV hug without tearing up and feeling devastatingly jealous. It's not even that I want romance, it's just that I want to know that someone out there cares about me. I love my parents, and they're very supportive, but I still have this huge gap in my life where I just want to actually talk to someone because they're my friend, not because they're my family. I've talked to my therapist. She called my social anxiety ""crippling"" which is a fair assessment. She's encouraged me to join various discord servers, and I have, but I find myself barely able to talk in them. Sure, I introduced myself and everything but after that I just feel so clueless about what to do, and I feel like even if I did talk more in them, it's just not quite the same as speaking with someone in the physical realm. I just feel so paralyzed by conversation. I feel like I'm the problem. I want to talk to somebody so bad, and the thought of being hugged literally makes me start to tear up. Coronavirus has made it so much harder, too. I just don't know what to do. Everyday day is the same. I wake up, I stay home all day, fantasize about something as simple as someone saying they like being in my company, and then cry because it feels just impossible. I really just want to have friends.

This is a tough one.

I would recommend waiting until your son asks you about his first dad.

If your son has not had his biological dad in his life for years now, he is used to not seeing him or knowing him.   You could tell him now, and he may not care or comprehend.  He may care more when he gets older and that may be a better time to tell him since it will be more relevant and he'll be older and able to understand it.

Assuming your son is 6 years of age, and he doesn't have any real feelings or knowledge of his first dad, you might be in the clear in telling him now.  I wouldn't say it was suicide, but you could say he passed away.

I would wait until your son brings him up ""Where is my first dad / can I go see him"" and then you break it gently to him that he is no longer living.  You can withhold information and it's not lying; you don't have to say it was suicide.  You will have to get creative here but really, only you know best - you're his mom!",13

Wars still occur across the world but compared to the 20th century, there are less wars/wars of smaller scale now. Generally though, the quality of living has increased in terms of access to healthcare, education (esp. with the internet) and while there are still many, many problems within society (e.g. healthcare being too expensive), we as a society has advanced greatly. Something that has most definitely gotten worse with time however, is climate change.",15

1618,Should I stop playing with my friend?,"So I have this friend who i play ps4 with. We have played for a while now but recently I've started to think about not being friends with him because sometimes he is very toxic. For example a couple days ago I was playing gta with him and we were doing the cayo perico heist and I could not find one of the key cards and he called me fucking retarded and started going off on me and when I stuck up for myself he called me a dick. A couple days ago I didnt feel good, all day I felt like I was going to throw up and I was getting light headed and I told him I wasnt going to get on that day he told me to take a nap and drink water then get on. He expects me to get on a play with him for 7 hours everyday sometimes he even wants me to play all hours of the night and when I say I want to get off cause I'm tired he says just go make a coffe. Before I took a break a couple days ago the last time we didnt play with each other for those 7 hours was before Christmas but if I say I dont want to get on he gets mad at me and when ever I stick up for my self he always calls me a dick even though almost every day I play with him he makes me feel like I'm worthless. But I dont know how to go about this because if I tell him I dont want to play with him anymore he will just keep messaging me and calling me but I will feel really bad if I just block him.

At the equator, a ring would be a thin line in the sky directly overhead; if the ring was too thin you might not be able to make it out at all, but if it was larger you'd be able to see a thin, gray strip crossing the sky.

As you moved closer to the poles, it would be easier to see planetary rings, they would be a greyish strip in an arc in the northern or southern half of the sky (the opposite of whichever hemisphere you're currently standing on).  The thicker the ring, the more clear it would be.

A planet the size of Earth that did have a ring would likely have a very small, thin ring that would be extremely hard to see, and it would go away after a few hundred thousand years or so due to gravity pulling it into the atmosphere.  Our planet just isn't big enough to have an impressive ring system like Saturn's.",29
1631,What's wrong with me?,"I don't want to have premarital sex.

Every time I even think about it, I just feel repulsed. I know, it seems silly, but it's starting to take up more space in my mind than I'd like it to. It seems that if you mention not having premarital sex on the internet, especially reddit, people get angry at you. Why do they do this? What is their motivation? What do they know that I don't? I'm not religious, and I have turned down the opportunity twice. Am I wrong for doing this? People in real life that I talk to don't seem to be offended when they ask me about why I won't have sex with that girl, why do the people of the internet react so explosively? What's wrong with me?",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c0753ed0>,1605723111.0,"Hey man this is a great and serious question for sure. I’ll give you my perspective. 
I am a pastors son, grew up with a great family who raised me right with very high moral standards and ideals, especially in regards to sexual purity.... but I’ve always struggled with accepting it for myself (that’s a quick sniper of another long another story for another time).
 
I always felt the same way, that I was not ever going to have sex before marriage... but when I was 17 I began dating a girl who didn’t share the same ideals and had a totally different concept of sex and marriage. She didn’t hold sex as an act to the same standards: it wasn’t a serious moral decision to her. The really rubbed off on my (no pun intended idontthink) and next thing I knew, we crossed all four bases, and I was no longer a virgin. 

Afterwards , I felt like I had  to keep it a secret to my family. My dad would kill me and my mom would be disappointed and sad for me. I’ve committed adultery- an intense sin... but at the same time the desire and love that came from it never seemed bad to me?

But we broke up and she ditched me and afterwards I felt like it was all for nothing. I had extreme guilt, both Bc I did that and lost it to someone who wasn’t going to be my wife, but also because I tasted what it actually felt like, and desired to do it again. 

I think what I’m trying to say is, it’s about whether you can be honest to yourself about what you really desire, and your family and friends opinions and personal life really does dictate part of that. If you feel like you will regret your decision, remember that you can never go back and change it once you’ve done it. I have now had sex with multiple girls and am more accepting and comfortable with my actions... but at the same time , in the back of my mind there is still the guilt and shame that comes with my upbringing: what if I’m a sinner? What if I’m judged by it? 

Just be honest with yourself. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be chaste. The fact that you’re not even religious and still have doubts makes me think that you maybe should wait, but if it’s the right person, then perhaps not....

Hopefully that wasn’t all bullshit to you. Hope you figure it out and my heart goes out to you",23

I found the guy and wanted to fuck him.

All of that aside.
As time has passed.  Ive found that I tell my boyfriend to hit me and choke me and all this violent rough stuff that I never did before. Is that normal? Is that fucked up? The rape wasn't violent. I was very disoriented. I let it happen without a fight because I was confused and scared... so it just sort of happened and then it was over. So why am I becoming so into violent rough sex? I feel like there is something wrong with me. Sometimes I feel like I just want to feel pain but other times we aren't violent or rough when we fuck. Idk. Does anyone have any opinions or experience with this sort of thing?

That’s not okay at all. Your daughter is almost an adult and she’s dating someone who isn’t even a teenager yet. Seriously, this kid is in middle school/7th or 8th grade, and your daughter is… a sophomore? A junior? Ridiculous. I encourage you to have a talk with your daughter about this and prevent it from happening. 

Your son… it’s a bit more complicated. I still wouldn’t allow it just because 14 and 16 are such different ages, but it’s not nearly as bad as 12 and 16. I don’t think it’s necessarily ‘pedo’ behavior, but it’s not the most appropriate thing either. I think you should have a talk with him anyway, but again, it’s not the worst thing that could happen.

ETA: I read some of your other comments. You don’t necessarily even have to do anything for kids to end up this way. I think the most important thing you could do in regards to your daughter is ask her why she thinks it’s appropriate to date a 12 year old, what her goals are from that relationship. I hope it’s nothing sexual, but honestly a romantic relationship isn’t appropriate here either. I’m not going to sit here and say your daughter is a sexual predator, but their relationship really isn’t appropriate. There is a common misconception that women cannot be predators; she may believe that she’s doing nothing wrong (again, I’m not saying she is a predator, but this is very inappropriate behavior), and perhaps it would be best to ask her what if the genders were switched?

1668,Am I Addicted To Music?,"I know that people can get addicted to the common stereotypes of Drugs, smoking, or, alcohol, but there's something I noticed with myself for a life-long time that I can't help but notice, and worry that it's messing with my health. 

In 2009, when I was around 10 or 11 years old, I was introduced to my first Walkman mp3 player. I never had any music player before that, and since that Christmas that I got my first mp3 player, I noticed that over the years, my mind kind of became dependent on the device. I would have my music playing in my ears for a great majority of the day, isolating myself from everything else, and even since then, it still goes on. I am 22 now. 

Throughout my childhood, I've gone above and beyond numerous methods to plug headphones in and listen, no matter when, nor where.  

Something I should probably mention as well is that I am autistic, I have Asperger Syndrome, and so I stim a lot when I listen to music (by involuntarily rocking on my seat while listening, and my eyes going around in a strange pattern through the room as I'm listening). When I do rock in my seat and play music through my mp3 (phone, nowadays), I escape to this different world, one that excludes me from reality entirely and let's my creation flow with ideas. I think of stories and fictional characters I can create for hours on my rocking chair, as I am also an artist, so I've begun calling this method ""Meditating"" over the years. It's my easiest way to explain it, really, because that's how it kind of feels. 

There have been instances where I've stimmed listening to my music for eight hours straight until my legs became sore enough from sitting in the same position for too long. As a kid I'd do this and put myself in quite a bit of pain this way. I'd wear my music and stim on school busses, car rides, on every couch my dad ever bought that I ever accidentally broke, etc., And it never stopped. On the bus, I had kids bullying me when they noticed, but I wouldn't stop, regardless of it. When someone nearby me asked me to stop rocking in my seat, to the point of yelling at me, I just started having a breakdown in my seat and cried my eyes out because I didn't want to. I felt like I psychically had no ability to stop, and if I did, I'd feel terrible or miserable. In my mind, I wasn't ever taking no for an answer. 

Also, When there is an instance where my headphones break, my music device stops working, or my mom simply grounded me from my mp3 player as a kid, my moods would fluctuate. A lot. And I would use wierd methods just to get my music working again.

I can remember a day I had as a kid where one of the speakers of my headphones broke off of the main base of the headphones, basically only letting me have one ear for music. This wasn't acceptable, though, for me, and so I did everything in my power to get that piece back onto my head. I say head because it wasn't even just my headphones at this point. When all other methods failed or the headphones felt too uncomfortable, I actually taped the entire disattached earphone to the side of my head. Once the other speaker fell off, I did the same thing to that side, and basically treated them like fat earbuds. I looked absolutely ridiculous, but I felt like I truly needed my time alone with my music. No matter how stupid I looked, I wasn't sitting in that car with my dad without my tunes. 

There had been once a time as well where my dad told me to stop rocking on the couch one day, as he was claiming I was breaking his couch. As I've said before my rocking is a key ingredient to my music that I preform involuntarily. Almost immediately, I was 13 at this time, I lunged the headphones onto the floor in this fit of rage, but said nothing as I barged out. This was basically one of the first times I had ever gotten that angry, ever, over something so trivial in my life. 

Another more recent reason, today in fact, the reason I am writing this post, is because today, I discovered that one of my cats chewed off the AUX cord to my pair of headphones that I use all the time for my music ""meditation"" yesterday night. This was something that was my fault, so no, I never yelled at or harmed my cat about it in any way. I love my babies to death. But regardless, my moods have been absolutely horrid the past two days. I've avoided talking to anyone out of worrying I'll upset someone, but because of this petty inconvenience that had an easy fix (I ordered a new pair that'll be arriving soon), my moods have been fluctuating and miserable. I've been irritated by the little things around irritable by small inconveniences, and I've been having to punch my pillow in the house to release anger from small things like losing at a game I usually have fun on, or my cats jumping up on my desk as I'm busy doing my work. 

I can't help but ask, because I'm curious, but it looks to me that I am indeed addicted to music, and it sucks to be honest. I truly don't know if my situation, but there's only so much you can do. all I hope right now is that those headphones come in soon and I can finally relax again. I've been made aware that you could be addicted to anything, and the feeling kind of feels a bit similar to that explanation, because I feel like I can't function without headphones on my head and music playing in my ears. I was always known in school as the kid who wore headphones all the time, because I'd only take them off in hallways or in classes. 

I think I have also managed to damage my ears because of the ringing that I've had in my ears since I was 12 and forward. I can only sleep with a fan on to drown out the sound of ringing that drives me nuts if there's nothing else to block it out. I hate the sound of the stupid ringing but of course, there's nothing I can do about it, and I caused it upon myself. 

I listen to music so frequently and on a pretty decently loud volume that I most likely have damaged my ears in that regard as well. 

The easiest way I could explain this, that I've been told by other people giving me actually pretty accurate examples, is that it feels like a sensation of ""Needing a smoke"". There's moments where I will have this feeling of needing to get up and give myself a music break or there will be times where I wouldn't feel like I would want to put on my headphones at that moment, and I'll do something else. When I do feel like I want to listen to some music on the chair and stim to myself it'll take a good hour or two nowadays, and it will relax me. I'll go back to what I was doing afterwords. 

Without the access of music and me feeling like I need to listen to my music at those times where I feel it's needed, it feels kind of that exact way. I get irritated, my moods fluctuate, I can become depressed, bored, tired, and I'll feel very uncomfortable. 

I'm honestly not sure what is up, but I'm surprised I haven't told my therapist about this. I'll be mentioning it to her.",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c0d7b090>,1608148558.0,I don’t think it’s possible to get “addicted” per say to music.

What value do other people's opinions bring to your life?

That's a bad question, bad me, what I mean is, whose opinion matters, why does it matter, and what influence does it have on you?

I actually extract *all* of my value from other people. To such a degree that a breakup or the end of a important relationship makes me worthless to the point of suicidal ideation.

I literally have no sense of self, I am committed to being whatever makes other people happy.

This is very detrimental, how much do you identify with that?

How high and how low does a person have the ability to make you feel?

How much power do they actually have?

Who are you and when do you find yourself sacrificing who you are to make others happy?

Think about all of that, come up with some answers, even if they're temporary.

Think about who you are again, and the person you want to be.

Then ask if those people with power deserve to have that power.

Those that do should only be your absolute closest of friends. People you trust, that you can rely on. There aren't many.

Give yourself permission to sacrifice something for those people, what you consider fair, but create a point where you'll bend no further. Decide which parts of yourself are non-negotiable and defend it with everything you have.

Value yourself for the person that you are. Require nobody else's opinion to determine who you are, what makes you happy, what you enjoy, etc. 

Love the person that you are and defend that person like you would your best-friend. Don't put up with people disrespecting you, putting you in positions you don't want to be in, or who go out of their way to make your life more difficult. Don't give crummy people the power of relevance.

I had to tear a lot down to rebuild and figure this out, I apologize if I'm not making a ton of sense, or if what I'm saying sounds cliche, it's just the logical process I put my brain through in order to start answering your question.

I would argue that most Christians are adapting to these progressive times and learning to not base their judgements off just one Bible verse, but also off other verses such as ""love thy neighbour as yourself"", or ""all people are made in God's image"".

In the past it was easy for Christians to hate gays because acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community is a relatively recent thing, however as the world progresses around them so are they.

1703,Am I Entitled?,"So, I am 17 and turning 18 in 6 days. I have never had a job. My mom has always said no and if I kept asking she would get mad and ground me and if I asked why I wasn't allowed to have a job, she would say ""cause I said so."" I have respected it for years. Now, I feel its time to get out into the working world and try to earn my own money. So I applied at a local fast food chain without telling my mom and I got an interview tomorrow. I finally told her and She seemed okay with it at first. But her and I got in an argument. I brought up that a lot of kids my age and younger have jobs and I'm almost 18 years old and have 0 working experience except for my time at Jobcorp. She tells me every time when I try to argue my point that I'm being an Entitled Millennial. Am I being entitled for wanting to work? I don't even know. I try not to be entitled, but maybe I am. My mom always brought up that it would affect her taxes if I get the job. If it does I will be more than happy to pay my part. anyways lmk, thank you.

Edit-

Thank you all for your insight. I have been feeling confused on the difference between doing the right thing or being selfish. I have always tried to get my mom's approval all my life. Obeying every word she said, of course not always happy about it. I've been taught to care for other. But I don't really know how to take care of myself. Of course I know how to cook for myself and what not. But I have been trying to find what I want and need in order to be happy. I thought that I needed my mom's support in getting a job. But she never does support things like this. She barely allowed me to get my ps4. It was a quiet car ride back home, but hey it was black friday. I just need to find myself, like a spirit walk or something. I worry that what comes next in my life will not involve my family as much. I understand staying in a toxic environment is not healthy, but she is still my family whether I like it or not. Family comes first but I guess need to put myself first for a while.

1731,I don’t understand why people say you’re not bad at math you just don’t study enough or you’re lazy ? What?,I studied from 9am-1pm using a test prep from a math help center which turned out to be useless. Passing those mini quizzes didn’t lead to me passing my test no matter how much time I spend studying over and over and over again. I’m supposed to believe I wasn’t working hard enough to try and understand the very thing I keep failing at. What kind of fucked up logic is that. Why can’t it be that some people just aren’t good at math no matter how basic ? I’ve taken simple math tests and passed some here and there. But I will never be good at math and that’s apparent from my childhood. I hate reading articles that say your skipping steps or not understand as if there isn’t a paper full of steps that still didn’t lead to the right answer. I’m just sick of studying for a math test that  I’m obviously not gonna pass. Why isn’t there an article that says “ Math isn’t for everyone” instead of “ why your bad at math” ?,questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c2086a90>,1614625918.0,"Thank GOD someone feels the same way as me. I see a lot of people in the comments saying “well maybe you really aren’t trying hard enough” or “you need to ask for help” like we haven’t tried that already. Not everyone can do math, just like not everyone can read or write. I don’t understand why people can’t understand that. I excel in pretty much every subject until it comes to math or any science that involves math (I’m great at it otherwise). 

Some of us truly are just bad at math and it’s not a “mindset” or whatever. I have no problem doing math when I can understand it, but most of the time it’s a bunch of numbers on a page that I just can’t make any sense out of. I prioritize my math classes and receive all the help and tutoring I can get, but I still do horrible on tests and homework because it just makes no sense to me. We can’t help it.",6
1732,"I'm scared that dad will physically abuse me, what should I do","Like the title says I'm scared, he has anger issues(adhd) and he can't controll his anger, every time he gets mad at something i get terrified that he will hit me, I want to clarify he hasn't done anything yet, but im scared he will, I dont feel safe around him, he has always been there for me, but im scared, and I'm too scared to talk to him about it as he has gotten really mad before when I have tried talking to him about stuff, and if he decides to start abusing me, nobody can stop him, we live alone, and I have to be at his house atleast every Monday and Thursday so I can take the buss to school.(The rest of the days I could stay with my mom)
And I also want to say that when he gets mad he doesn't just shout, he hits objects like tables the walls and other stuff, im scared he is going to move on from the objects to me, and he gets mad at every little thing like I just murdered somebody, no matter how small it is.
And he also keeps telling me I'm lazy and nothing good will come from me and keeps asking me if I'm an idiot, if I'm dumb constantly, and not in a joking facion, I cant take this anymore, every day I feel worthless and I have suicidal thoughts atleast once a day, and this has been going on for 2-3 years now.

1733,wisdom teeth removal questions- urgent please read,"I got my wisdom teeth removed yesterday. I get put to sleep, and I wake up after about 45 minutes. I was fighting during the sedation. They decided to pull out the remaining two teeth under local anesthetic instead of putting me back to sleep. I could feel everything. Now it’s worth noting that I consider myself to have a pretty high pain tolerance. They restrained my wrist and a nurse was holding my head down and another was holding my feet down. I kept asking why I was awake and I couldn’t understand. I kept saying it was hurting me as they were pulling my other teeth out. It was the worst pain I’ve ever experienced. I was screaming and crying. The nurses tried to explain what was happening but it was while I was in excruciating pain. Nobody took a second to stop and explain what was going on. A second oral surgeon was in there at one point. People kept going in and out. I currently have a rash on my wrist from trying to get out of the restraints. I would love if anyone in the dentistry field could answer but really any advice or opinions would be appreciated.
1. Why didn’t they put me back to sleep? I was clearly in pain and crying and screaming. I figured that if I was fighting them under sedation they would just give me a higher dose. Please inform me
2. Why could I feel everything as they were pulling my teeth? At first, I thought maybe I was just in a state of shock from waking up during surgery and maybe it didn’t hurt that bad. But the more I think about it, the more I KNOW I was in true excruciating pain. An important thing to note here is that my family has a history of not reacting well to novacane. Could that be why mine hurt?  no idea if novacane is what was used in my surgery
3. Am I incorrect (morally or legally speaking) in thinking that the dentist should have made sure the local anesthetic was working? He kept reassuring me that it was just pressure and not pain, not stopping once. I understand he had a job to do but I’m truly traumatized from the experience. Maybe there’s something I’m missing (actually it’s very likely that there’s something I’m missing) so any help/advice would be helpful.
4. Has anyone else had an even remotely similar experience
By the way,I literally made an account just for this.
Even after the surgery, I got very little explanation. The surgeon didn’t even speak to me. Nobody addressed my pain. Nobody addressed why a second oral surgeon had to step in or why people were running in and out of the room. I was told the surgery would be about 30 minutes and it ended up being about 2 hours. Which would be totally fine if I was given a better explanation of why.

1735,"Has anyone capable of jumping, lived their whole life without jumping?","I've recently been having a rather profound topic within my own head, and in my desperate search for answers I cannot seem to find a single answer. I'll be including a TL;DR section at the bottom, hopefully both of which will make sense to those interested in the full take and those for just the necessary question.

I would also like to follow this, I'll mention in the TL;DR section aswell, but this is in regards to those who are physically able to jump. Yes, there are people who are not born able-bodied. This question isn't meant to be replied with ""Yeah if someone has no legs obviously they lived their life without jumping."" And, those who have reasonably lived their lives past childhood and are in adulthood. I shouldn't have to say this aswell, but this isn't asking if a tragic loss of a newly born who ""lived their life"" didn't jump. I'm only looking for people who have been fortunate enough to live long enough and without some disability that prevents them from jumping. And this is because it directly ties in with the question, I am asking this because of a lack of factual information on this topic.

So, for starters I've tried a few hours worth of searching, with every single search for the answer to this I have found absolutely nothing. Now typically you can make a search like ""most peppers eaten in an hour"" and find PLENTY of videos, articles, and sites showing what you have specified. Now, you can reasonably conclude that there are also people who have never eaten any peppers before aswell. For whatever reason I cannot find ANY forums, research, pages, videos or any related topics to this. What is more problematic is, by searching ""jump"" I get all kinds of unrelated things to the act of jumping with ones' legs. I get parachute jumps, motorcycle jumps, just about every jump even jump ropes. And these are all followed up by records being broken or the most. I'm trying to find the least or none, and it ties into a more hypothetical question in a sense.

It seems like everyone finds someway to teach their children to jump. Or they simply learn how on their own.  Or, what hurts this question more is how many schools encorporate jumping into a physical routine.

Now, health reasons aside, why is this? In the day-to-day life, many people do not need to jump. I cannot recall a single time I needed to jump where my life depended on it. Infact, any situation where I have chosen to jump, I could have also not jumped and still gotten to the same location. I don't need to jump up stairs I could walk up. I still do jump up, but this is besides the point.

Now there are most definitely situations in which- jumping would save oneself. There are also situations in which jumping would not save you. Now, arguably there are people who would never NEED to jump in their lives to save themselves from any situation. Yet we seem to teach people to jump. Something that arguably would be a standard psychological reaction to an approaching danger would it not be? 

My question is, is there any record of someone who, was fully capable of jumping by using their legs and feet, but they managed to live their whole life without jumping?

There simply has to have been a human who has the ability to run, to walk, to kneel, to squat their own body weight even. And, by all physical means this individual should simply be able to jump aswell. Surely, there is somehow, somewhere a human who throughout all of their life has not once jumped. 

Which, here is where my ""Schrödingers Jump"" question comes into fruition. If, this person who was fully capable of jumping lived their full life, and during this life they did not once jump, my question is, Did they truly have the ability to jump? They never jumped in their life. So for all we know there was something that prevented them from jumping.

(TL;DR) Has anyone lived their whole life capable of jumping, and never jumped?",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c20d6090>,1600917415.0,"a very specific question.

I am on my way to work at the hospital as I am a Registered nurse. 

I stop by ATM in back of bank (6AM). As I am checking my balance,  not withdrawing funds, a white pick up truck pulls up. 

There are 3 Hispanic males, 2 in cab and one sitting in back of pick up. As I turn to walk back to my car the drivers starts yelling at me ""little bit$&"". I am a big dude, so not used to random people shouting out insults to me. 

I just continue to walk to car, not engaging. As I open my car door I see the Male who was sitting in back of pick up truck coming towards me. I just get in car and he motions me to roll down window. I just start car and back up. The white pickup attempts to block me and I get out. I pull on main road and they follow me half a mile before doing a quick Uturn. 

I am now starting shift, but feel anger I allowed myself to be fearful. It's a mix of feelings, most likely due to adrenaline.  Again, being a big dude I found it odd I was approached like this. I feel I would have been more of a problem for them than another target, unless there was a gun involved. Assuming this was an attempted robbery which is my question.

1766,"My mom was likely murdered years ago, how do i find out who killed her?","TLDR: How do i find out more info on my mothers death. I also realized i needed to tell this story somewhere sorry if its the wrong subreddit.


My mom died in 2001 i believe it was and her bones were found in a creek north of Denton Tx. We lived in a small suburb East of Dallas. I was 10 or 11 and i am now 29. This happened about a year after my dad died from kidney issues from diabetes. It was stress induced diabetes from seeing his dad blow his brains out.  

Anywho back to my mom, From what i know the police knew it was her through dental records but i was so young i don't have any details. My older siblings have filled me in on a bit but the details are very sparse. 

My older brother says that my mom thought people were out to kill her and i vaguely remember her saying these things when i was younger but again i was super young and have a terrible memory from all that's happened. I do think she may have been schizo until... She was seemingly murdered. 

My oldest brother said she talked to him several times that night and that she was at this party, the night she went missing, and it felt like ""seance"" like she was in the center of attention or something. She called again later saying she was coming home but was lost (i think).

From what i know the police found her truck near the wooden area she was found in with her door wide open and her belongings still in the vehicle. They found only parts of her remains.


How do i find out who killed her? Im wondering who to talk to or how do i find out details like Investigaters, city or county, persons of interest, cause of death etc. 



I always wanted to send this info to a cold case podcast for crowd sourced info but i thought this was easier for now.

I feel much better now after typing this. So even if no-one reads im happy to have spent the time.

Love those you have because tomorrow is never guaranteed.",questions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2c2454cd0>,1580867964.0,I would assume the local police station at the place of the murder would allow you to access certain records. Maybe city officials at the time could help or yeah even sending into a cold case podcast could work. I feel like your best chance is to just find more information through sources of that time and area. I've never had to track down a killer but that would probably be the first place I'd start.

I don’t do it for attention or anything and will go to my own little secluded area so I don’t bother any families/kids.   
I’ve always worn thongs to the beach here in NY, but I’ve noticed a huge change in people’s looks at me over the years, but for the most part I noticed that most people just don’t care at all anymore. They would look at me and turn away and in the past people would look at me for a long time and laugh under their breaths. I’m also noticing a lot more guys wearing thongs or briefs at the beach so is this “trend” becoming more accepted by society nowadays?  
Although I personally wear thongs, I also find that older men (50+) who do so to be extremely creepy and doing so out of a fetish or simply just looking to “cruise”.

Those boys loved me. They knew I was hurting. They wouldn't have made fun of my song selection. I understand that now, but I didn't then.

I don't believe in afterlife, I don't think I can shame or let down the dead. I don't think they're watching me and expecting anything. But I was ashamed of my cowardice. And I've tried since then to be more open with my emotions and the things I appreciate. 

Anyway. Shout out to a baby that's been gone for twenty five years.

Thiamine. Niacin. Folate. Magnesium. Manganese. Iron. Selenium.

Rice is also gluten-free and highly digestible, making it a good option for people with food allergies or sensitivities.

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is a refined grain. This means that brown rice contains the bran and germ, which are the outer layers of the grain kernel. The bran and germ are removed during the milling process to produce white rice.

Rice is a good source of carbohydrates, which provide energy for the body. It is also a good source of some vitamins and minerals, including:

Thiamine (vitamin B1): Thiamine is essential for converting food into energy and for maintaining a healthy nervous system.

Niacin (vitamin B3): Niacin is important for energy production, cell growth and repair, and the nervous system.

Folate: Folate is important for cell growth and repair, and for the development of a fetus during pregnancy.

Magnesium: Magnesium is important for muscle and nerve function, blood pressure regulation, and bone health.

Manganese: Manganese is important for bone health, blood sugar regulation, and metabolism.

Iron: Iron is important for carrying oxygen throughout the body.

Selenium: Selenium is an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage.

Rice is also gluten-free and highly digestible, making it a good option for people with food allergies or sensitivities.

Brown rice vs. white rice

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is a refined grain. This means that brown rice contains the bran and germ, which are the outer layers of the grain kernel. The bran and germ are removed during the milling process to produce white rice.

As a result, brown rice is more nutritious than white rice. Brown rice contains more fiber, protein, and vitamins and minerals than white rice. However, white rice is easier to cook and has a longer shelf life than brown rice.

The recommended daily intake of grains for adults is 6 ounces. One ounce of cooked rice is about 1/2 cup. Therefore, adults should aim to eat 3-6 servings of rice per day.

It is important to note that rice is high in carbohydrates. People with diabetes or other health conditions should talk to their doctor about how much rice is safe for them to eat.",3

this is my sleep paralysis story (sorry for bad english)

I was at my cousins house when I was 8. I was there with my sister, she was 9, my cousin, he was 8 and me. his mother and little brother. their father was in Poland because he was a firefighter. we wanted to be 'cool kids' and stayed up till 12 pm (24:00). my sister fell asleep first. me and my cousin were talking till he fell asleep. I toight to myself 'I am asleep I am asleep I am asleep' -basically only that for an hour. I fell asleep. I always had bad dreams, I had fear of the dark, and monsters that don't usually exist. at 3 am I woke up with a big urge to drink water. I went downstairs and saw the couch their cat and dog sat on, playing together. they were dead, sadly. i got water and I saw something outside - not being worried, thinking it's their new dog (Sasha). after that I went back, and I closed the door to our room, and went to bed. the room was kinda big, the bed being close to the window, with a desk, an old TV and a balcony. there was a middle room wich we were never allowed in. I wasn't interested anyways. then there was his mother's room. it was a big room, but alway messy. the next room was the bathroom, wich was a big bathroom with a window that always scared me for no reason. then downstairs it was very spacious and another small bathroom. the kitchen was connected with no door. it was the typical easter European house. as I close the small flashlight I was holding. it rolled under the bed. I was on the left side of the bed, the closest to the door with full vision. my cousin was in the middle and my sister was on the floor. the tv had a fireplace video playing. it was relaxing. then I closed my eyes. I slept for about 30 minutes. then, I heard a car in the driveway. he lives in a small town, close to hungary in the western side of Oradea. not many people went trough that neighbourhood. it defenedly was a neighbour of his. the road light was blowing trough the window wich was half covered by the curtain. the house was really cold but we slept with blankets. all I tought about was Christmas. it was winter. then when I opened my eyes, I saw a dark and tall figure in the hallway. it was faceless. it had long hair. the only feature that would've been noticeable was the red, glowing eyes. I tough to myself 'it's just another nightmare. it'll go away'. it wasn't - I noticed that another car passed because of the lights. they brightened up the hallway for a few seconds. my eyes moved around. wait- was the door opened? didn't I close it when I went to sleep? I was confused. very confused even. what was that. his father? no, no he was in Poland. his mother? no, she isn't that tall. was it.. my father? but he was dead! it couldn't be our grandparents, they were all dead... what was it? it was holding a dog. a white dog. it looked like his dead dog. I wanted to get up and close the door. my legs nor arms weren't able to move. was I dead? no, I couldn't be. why was my imagination so weird at 8? I looked at my cousin with the corner of my eye. he slept with his sheep plushie. I was the only one awake. then I noticed the pain on my chest. something was pressing it. but nothing was there. was i going insane or just hallucinating? the tv was still on. it was flickering. white and black. it seemed to not give any light. only the image flickering on the tv. but no light in the room. what was even that? the figure approached me. I was scared. I wanted to scream. the only thing that came out of my mouth was between a silent whisper and a zombies whimper. I started sweating. it was cold. but I was sweating. I was panicking. I closed my eyes but nothing changed. the figure was still aproaching me. my mind was blank. only thing I could think of was a prayer. the figure got on the bed, scratching my leg. there was no pain. it started choking me. I woke up by my cousin- was it a dream..? but why did it feel so... real? everyone was awake. I got out of bed. my eyes were red, but not of crying. my aunt pointed out that I didn't sleep all night... but I did sleep. there was broken glass on the kitchen floor and my cousins dog, Sasha was barking at the passing neighbour's as they patted her. I got up, and went to the bathroom. after that I started eating. what just happened last night?

2312,I can’t breathe. Black lives matter.,"As the gap of the political divide in our world grows deeper, we would like to take a few minutes of your time or express our support of equal treatment, equal justice, to express solidarity with groups which have been marginalized for too long, and to outright say black lives matter. The AskReddit moderators have decided to disable posting for [8 minutes and 46 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjKo_rpVid0) — the time George Floyd was held down by police — and we will lock comments on front page posts. Our hope is that people reading this will take a moment to pause and reflect on what can be done to improve the world. **This will take place at 8PM CDT.**

AskReddit is a discussion forum with which we want to encourage discussion of a wide range of topics. Now, more than ever, it’s important to talk about the topics that divide us and use AskReddit to approach these conversations with open minds and respectful discussion.

This is also an important opportunity to reiterate our stance on moderation. Simply put, we believe it’s our duty to ensure neutral and fair moderation so people with opposing views can use our platform as a place to have these important and much needed discussions about their views, our hope being that the world will benefit as a result. We feel that it is our duty to make sure that AskReddit is welcoming to all. To that end, we have a set of rules to ensure posts encourage discussion and to ensure users feel safe, welcome, and respected. As always, blatant statements of racism or any other kind of bigotry **will not be tolerated**. We want users to be able to express themselves and their views. Remember that everyone here and everyone you see in the news are human beings, too.

With all of that in mind, we reiterate our encouragement for people to discuss these hard, and often uncomfortable, topics as a way to find alignment, unity, and to progress as a society.

We ask that you take a few minutes to research a charity that aligns with your beliefs or a cause you care about and that you donate to it if you’re able. [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-floyd-protests-bail-funds-police-brutality-black-lives-matter-1008259/) put together a lot of links to different funds across many states if you would like to use this as a place to start.

\-The AskReddit mods",AskReddit,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x2d1344e50>,1591143244.0,"I want to start by saying that when I say Black Lives Matter- there is an implied “too” at the end. I am NOT saying my life matters more, or your life matters less. Just that mine is equally important and not viewed as such by unfortunately, many people. “All Lives Matter” is disrespectful because it negates the purposeful attention we are trying to draw to black injustice specifically. I need you to please understand that racism is not the racism they taught us in school anymore.

Modern racism is giving black people higher interest rates or bad loans (which a bank was sued millions for doing in 2017!). It’s relators purposely not showing black people houses in nicer areas. It’s companies only hiring 1-5 black people for their quota and not for their merit, which is ironically racist towards whites who potentially deserved it more- spurring more division. It’s colleges only accepting black people to make themselves look good on paper instead of actually valuing that students strengths & potential. It’s enforcing laws in school that don’t allow black people to wear their natural hair because it is “unprofessional” and a “distraction” to other students. It’s makeup companies only having 1-3 dark foundation shades because we are a “demographic” without money & thus not worth pursuing- and then suddenly coming out with more shades once they see how successful Rihanna was when she acknowledged us. It’s crooked police purposely going into low income areas, scanning license plates, and purposely ticketing people they know cannot afford it, so that they will go to jail for outstanding tickets and become a part of the for-profit prison pipeline. It’s fashion companies & movies using damaging stereotypes of black people instead of showing how diverse and beautiful our people are, thus instilling an untrue idea of what “black people” are to others across the world (imagine you’re from a place with no black people- if all the movies & shows portray us a certain way, you’ll assume that must be true).

When  I first started at my old place of employment, a very nice tech company, I had a black  janitor stop me one morning as I was heading up to the office, tears in  his eyes. He gripped my shoulder; his hands frail, wrinkled- and told me  how proud of me he was. How happy he was that a little black girl was  working at “one of them tech companies”. I hugged him & told him  thank you. When I tell you I ran to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out.  I was so grateful, but that is a heavy burden to carry- not only was I  working for me, I was working for him, for all my ancestors who didn’t  have a chance. And when I was let go 2 months ago, it hit hard because it felt like  not only did I fail me, I failed them. I realize it was not my fault, a  virus hit the country and I was a part of a mass layoff. But do you see  how race played into my emotional state, something most others wouldn’t  have to deal with?

So please, when you see Black Lives Matter, when you see protest, know that all we’re asking for is change. Yes we have civil rights, but why are you scoffing at us asking for more? Why are we expected to accept the bare minimum? As a kid (mind you I was born in 1996) I was given the talk that my skin means I have to conduct myself a certain way, in certain environments, for my own safety. That people will fear me for simply having too much melanin. That I will be black first, yourelovely second until I die. I am trying my hardest to create a future where I don’t have to give my kids that same speech, where I don’t have to pass down that generational trauma.

If you have questions about the protesting, the movement, modern racism- ask me please! I know it can be a heated topic and the only way to change that is to have an open dialogue and educate. This is me offering the olive branch, me saying I am hurting and still have nothing but love in my heart. Too often we are too busy trying to share our thoughts that we don’t hear others.

EDIT: I've gotten a lovely amount of responses- I'm in Boston & its currently 12:13 am, I'm trying to get a semi-regular sleep schedule on track so I'll probably be heading to bed soon, please know if I don't get back to you tonight I will tomorrow! All love & hugs from me, thank you for making a girl feel heard",16988

In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.

Edit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O

2318,How do you feel about ’how would you feel?’ posts being banned?,"We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \_\_\_\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.

We do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.

For example:

* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.
* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.

Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.

Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.

Every week I had to take a big group of campers to a ""secluded"" spot for their wilderness survival badge where they had to build a shelter out of sticks, leaves, etc and sleep in it overnight. The spot was only about 1/2 mile from the main camp, but we took them a circuitous route that made it seem really secluded.

Anyways, on this one night all the campers had made their shelters, we had cooked dinner, and were all just sitting around the campfire. It was getting late, maybe 11:00, so I sent all the campers to their shelters for the night and started cleaning up the fire. That's when we heard in the distance what sounded like church bells. They were pretty faint, but myself and my fellow staffers could definitely hear them. They went on for about 30 minutes, ringing every 30 seconds, or so. We were all a little creeped out, as there were no churches or towns within 20 miles of us. After the bells stopped, though, the singing started. It was too faint to hear the words, but it sounded like church choir music, but **a lot** of people, and **a lot** more enthusiastic. Also, it was almost midnight at this point. The singing went on for well over an hour, sometimes quieting down until we almost couldn't hear it, sometimes getting so loud we thought it was getting closer.

All of the campers were super creeped out, but I lied to them, telling them there was a church service going on in camp, and that there was nothing to be scared of. Eventually, at almost 1 AM, the singing stopped. I found out a few days later that there had been a large KKK rally only a few miles away that night, and that's what we had heard.",43041

The you now is just as real as the you then. We all adapt to our surroundings and change to make our lives easier. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

If you're unhappy with your life now, you can adapt by changing. You need to believe that, and you probably know it since it seems to be something you're afraid of. But this is the real you now, and you need to focus on the needs of that person, not some idealized phantom from the past.",34377

1. Accept that perfection doesn't exist. Your relationships will have problems, your car will break down, someone else will anyways have a better phone, a newer car, or a bigger house than you, no matter where on the social ladder you stand. Constantly chasing perfection will keep you permanently stressed. That doesn't mean you should not try to better your life, just know that if you expect perfection you will never be statisfied. 

2. Pay attention to your diet and health. I have been working out at least 4 times per week since my mid 20's. I am fitter, healthier and look younger than almost everyone else my age

3. Don't stop doing the things you love. Even though I have a wife, kids, job etc. I still make time to play video games, draw, write stories, read comics, play basketball, listen to music, etc. There is no reason to become a miserable old bastard!

EDIT: Wow! This has blown up way more than I expected. Thanks for the awards a guys. Its nice to know my advice can be useful to others.

EDIT 2: So, quite a few people have asked how I find time to fit in all these hobbies. As I said, I have to make the time. Apart from working out (which I do at 6am before everyone else wakes up) I'm not doing these things every day. I only game on the weekend if I get the chance, I read ebooks on my phone when I'm killing time in the day, I may buy a comic 2-3 times a year and I can usually find a few hours in the week to draw. I still make time to chill out with my wife in the evenings and do things with kids. I just fit my hobbies in between them. I also don't watch much TV or go out, but that's just me.",42330

They seperated half a year after the wedding and my friend, the bride, told me, that the marriage had been a way to prolong the relationship despite both of them knowing that it was already over some time before they got married.

Enforcing accountability in child support provided expenses just opens up the worst legal can of worms imaginable. 

edit: as for why I'd like to see it: I don't have any visibility into how my money gets spent and it irks me. Further more, my ex frequently rings up and asks for the next support payment early. Yes, often times there are valid reasons. So and so needed shoes. Fees for school trips. etc. But I also know she spends way above her means on a lot of fun, entertainment based discretionary things, then she realizes ""whups, can't buy groceries! tee hee! pleeeeeze?"". So she gets to be the ""fun"" parent. Welp kids, looks like we're going for long walks in the park again this weekend. Hooray for the library.

edit2: ok, 600 replies. Child support is contentious on Reddit. So far, the themes are:

- yes, its 2017, we should have the technology to implement this. Maybe some magic debit card or EBT style.
- no, current child support departments are bunged up enough, this would kill them.
- stop giving in to your ex - if she asks for money early in the future just ask what she needs specifically and buy it for her, then take that off the subsequent payment - GOOD idea!.
- people are petty.
- so put a law like this in motion. But to prevent abuse, the cost for an audit is borne by the parent who asked for it... or variations on that (I _like_ that idea.)

2398,Would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? Kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? Why or why not ?,,AskReddit,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1582e2810>,1557519948.0,"Not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the US in the Depression.  It was called the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country.  The reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the Dust Bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the US was not a bottomless well of natural resources.  (Erosion was a big cause of the Dust Bowl, and the Dust Bowl was a factor in the Depression, so it all tied together.)  They were also called ""Roosevelt's Tree Army,"" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control.  

In my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture.  You can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive.  (I'm actually going to stay in one next week.)  Some of them have photos from the CCC days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on.  

I'd definitely support a program like that today, but I think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it.  Plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated.  With the CCC, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out.  It would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start.

Edit:  A number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins I mentioned.  The ones I'm familiar with are in Pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/.  Not all cabins are CCC-built, but ones listed as ""rustic"" often are--check individual park websites for details.  (There's usually a ""stay the night"" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a ""history"" page that will talk about CCC's role in the park.)  Rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a Pennsylvania resident.  The system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly.  Some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ADA-accessible unit.   

Other states and some national parks also have CCC-built cabins available for rental, but as far as I know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are.",25942

We were signing the contract for the event and I kept thinking that it was quite remote, so I asked: ""how much time does it take for the ambulance to get here?"" 

I became the laughing stock of both families. My (then future) mother in law, who was present at the meeting, literally fell down from the chair laughing. The wedding organizer, remembered it for weeks, telling about it everyone we met. My dad, ended every sentence with ""...but maybe you need an ambulance for that"". My wife was making siren noises, when I was saying something we disagreed on. Every family dinner all the aunts and uncles were ""checking"" if the ambulance was present. You name it. The entire package.

Still I couldn't get rid of this weird feeling. It would have taken over an hour for the ambulance to get to the garden. After a few weeks I ended up paying a private ambulance to be present at the wedding.

Fast forward to the ceremony. As my wife literally walks down the aisle, at the back of the garden I see two Paramedics running with a stretcher and my dad squeezing my hand whispering: ""that's not of your god damn business, let them to take care of it. ""

What happened was that one of our older guests got a heart attack and almost died at ceremony. Was saved by the private ambulance.

Ever since then, when my wife tells me that I'm overthinking, I just do the siren noise.





EDIT

Well... thanks for the awards everybody, glad you liked the story. I promise you that I was tired of winning after that. They never heard the end of it, but all the laughs were in good spirit. I apologized to the guy's kids for ruining their inheritance plans and he was saying that the service was so boring that he preferred to take his chances with the heart attack. So we had a few more laughs and trolling. 

Some of you are asking how much did the ambulance cost. I don't remember as it was many years ago and I may not be from your country. But does it matter? Can one really put a price on the ""I told you so"" you can use anytime you want with your Mother In Law?",54285

The woman did not know she wasn’t going to be coming home, until she got to the airport and her husband went to the toilet and she realised only he had a return ticket. 
She somehow managed to quickly think to hide her bangle so that she could set the metal detector off and have to be searched. As the officer was up close and searching her, the woman whispered “help me”. The officer quickly took her for a private search, grabbed the woman’s bags and passport too ‘as protocol’ and went into the private search room. The woman fell on the floor crying, begging for help, so they called the police. The husband started to get suspicious and tried to break his way into the room and the officer had to push against the door, thankfully the police turned up straight away and restrained him.

There was one guy, in the east Midlands, UK, who was one of the adult instructors. He was always telling us about amateur radio, and would hand out old/cheaper pieces of tech he'd tried out and wasn't keeping.

Anyway, he was a little weird, overly friendly (with adults, never had any bad vibes around the kids) and obviously had some social anxiety which he was compensating for, personally I suspect he was on the autistic spectrum, but who knows. After I left the cadets and went to Uni, I stayed in touch on Facebook. We were in the same Facebook group for amateur radio hobbyists.

He always liked to do things by the book, and instilled in us the importance of being responsible and socially conscious with our radio use. He was the same on Facebook, reminding people that Mrs Miggins on her £10 handset wouldn't know about transmission power, and squelch, etc. He mentioned in passing to a new member the importance of only using the public unlicensed channels (kind of like CB Radio in the US) on the correct, very low, power setting of half a watt. He mentioned it was because Mrs Miggins trying to reach her kid in the next street wouldn't understand the idea that she could hear you but couldn't reach you to ask you to be quiet a minute. He was correct here, and it's also a criminal offence to transmit at higher power on these frequencies, even though its not enforced. 

Anyway, this got someone's back up, and he was kicked from the group for ""preaching"".

After unsuccessfully asking to be let back in, he set up a larger antenna in his back garden, set up a super fancy aerial atop it, with a 30 Watt transmission system... (this is really quite powerful) 

He now turns this on for several hours a day on whatever channels the radio club/group are using to 'teach them the importance of good etiquette'. This means that nobody can use certain frequencies for hours at a time, as it just sounds like someone is having a one way conversation on air.

He could probably get arrested, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all.",31095

Edit: I exported everything since 01-01-2017 from [here](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive), hassled a bit with the U.S. date and time format and then did a simple subtraction between each subsequent tweet time.

Edit2: 27 hours so far, which leaves 21 cases where at least this long has passed between 2 tweets since the beginning of 2017. In 6 more hours (33 hours since the last tweet), this will be down to 6 cases over the same time period - 33,7 hours, 34 hours, 37,3 hours, 38,5 hours, 40,3 hours and 45,9 hours. This should probably cover the interesting information.

Edit3: The president has returned: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1109787378242240514 The final count was 39 hours 46 minutes, which makes this the 3rd largest gap between tweets during this presidency.

I’m a speech therapist who works in an inner city elementary children where we see a lot of poverty, drug abuse, etc. I had one case stand out to me in particular that stands out. 

I saw a little girl, 7 years old, who had been delayed on her language skills. We knew she had a very difficult upbringing since she was the product of a rape. She lived only with her mother who impressively kept the two events (the rape and the birth of her daughter) as separated as possible. The rapist (who I refuse to call a father) had served time in jail but was released at this point on house arrest. He had no rights to see her. But the rapist’s parents, technically the child’s grandparents, went to court and  demanded rights to see their “granddaughter”. They refused to ever believe their son was a rapist. Some judge, who I hope thinks of this case often, allowed it as long as father was not present. It started as supervised visits and eventually turned into visitation without supervision. Mom fought as hard as she could, but she couldn’t afford a lawyer like the grandparents could. Mom had to drop her daughter off to the parents of her rapist every other weekend for one night. I don’t know how she did it.

Anyways, I started to see a huge regression in her language skills. Her mean length of utterance decreased, she couldn’t logically organize her thoughts into sentences, she couldn’t categorize anymore and so forth. Academically when I spoke to the teacher she said the same thing. But it really came to a head when she started to regress in other, non-school related skills. 
One day she wet her pants in my classroom. And she just lost it. She was crying, she destroyed my room, she was hitting and punching to the point where I had to restrain her from hurting herself. She just lost it. Finally when she calmed down, I brought her down to the nurse, got her a change of pants. But this was a girl was not only potty trained since Id known her, but she was known for being sweet, polite and just slow to warm up. She was NOT a child to have outbursts like this. She wasn’t sick. And I felt like I really needed to say something outside the school.

Long story short, grandparents were sneaking over to fathers house so that her “father could see and help raise his daughter”. Turns out he started inappropriately touching her in the bathroom, during tub time, at the kitchen table, watching TV. Basically any chance he could when the grandparents walked out the room for any amount of time.

My heart broke for the mom. I’ll never forget her telling us about how she couldn’t live with herself knowing the fact that the man who raped her, also touched her daughter. Anyways, you can probably imagine all the hurt and heartbreak the mother felt.",32468

As soon as he heard that and the police leaving he tore down the wall (hed already been working on this apparently) and robbed the place taking his sweet time. Escaped without anyone noticing anything for hours, until the jewellers came back in the morning.

The online threats were funny, but when I started getting death threats by mail I backed the fuck off.

edit: I didn't think this would blow up like it did, but to answer a few common questions,

- I posted a bunch or criticism of the CoS in the Usenet group alt.religion.scientology. This was in the late '90s and well before most modern forums and content aggregators like Reddit existed (Fark was the big one and Digg was just starting to get popular).

-I was high school (for non Americans, grades 9-12)

-I was in high school and was using my home computer as an FTP server for a Warez group on IRC because I convinced my dad to sign up for a 90 day free trial of this new thing called ""broadband."" I had 3 Mbps down and 1.5 Mbps up. Of course we never cancelled it.

-They figured out who I was by using a CuteFTP vulnerability to get root directory access to my PC. The death threats were bad enough, but what really sticks with me is the malice of deleting my family photos including the last picture is us with my dad whole he was alive.

-I was the typical invincible-feeling young adult and I was more concerned about worrying my mom than I was about my own safety.

-This was long before ""doxxing"" was a thing, and online threats going from email to handwritten letters was terrifying, but as a high school kid I never would have admitted it.

-Nobody asked, but if I was confronted in person I would have fought back. 18 years later, if they really held a grudge and threatened me again with the same malice expressed in those letters I got, I would open the door with a gun in hand and if they tried to get in, I would assume that they were intending to kill me and shoot first.

-This is a serious post so as funny as it would be to accept the previous statement with the autocomplete error ""shit first,"" I fixed it.",27975

The reason the glass slipper in Cinderella didn't turn back to a regular slipper (or disappear) at midnight is because the Fairy Godmother was messing with us: her main goal was to set Cinderella up for life, and to do that she needed a way for the Prince to find her. She could easily have magicked Cinderella into the life she wanted, arbitrary midnight deadline be damned, but instead the Fairy Godmother decided to make the Prince want her for her own qualities and to prove his love by tracking Cinderella down. To do that, she had to make sure that something was left behind, so she popped that little glass sumbitch off so the Prince would have a lead to follow.

* All those times you just accepted things that were girly without ever attracting any kind of attention to it really went a long way towards helping me build a healthy perception of guys. You never expressed any kind of disdain or machismo when I asked for your help untangling my Barbie's hair or prodding you with magic fairy wands. 

* You never hesitated to teach me practical skills - and you never attributed gender to them. It was always, ""Come over here and let me show you how to snake the drain, because you're going to need to do this."" BTW dad, I snaked my first drain all on my own last month! I'm so glad you taught me.

* Thank you for bailing me out when I was in a pinch, no questions asked. No guilting, no attempts at squeezing out information. I felt like I could come to you with any dilemma. This took a load of my shoulders because Mom is so reactive and ""freak out first, maybe resolve later."" 

* You respect me, which makes me respect you even more. When I call you out on BS, you actually repent and reflect. You don't deflect back on me and pull the, ""I'm the parent and know better than you"" spiel. 

* You actually took the time to sit and watch my cartoons or (attempt) to understand my video games or other hobbies. Mom always turned up her nose. You didn't. Do you know how awesome it is to watch your Dad actually laugh at the cartoon your mother just dismissed as ""dumb"" minutes before? So gratifying.

* All those times you went shopping for groceries and picked up ladies sanitary supplies without any hesitation, even if you did affectionately rename the long super maxi pads, ""low-salt maxis.""

* Thank you for all those secret times you let me pick something out of the vending machine to eat when we were on trips together - you knew Mom would never allow it.

* You take great pride in ""embarrassing me"" - but you know exactly where to draw the line so it's endearingly goofy, not genuinely embarrassing. You know your audience and play to it. I feel no shame when my friends (or now-fiance) are around you.

* It's okay if your hands were too callused to properly tie my ballet skirt before classes. I could tie it myself. But I didn't tell you at the time because I knew it made you happy to help me. So don't be embarrassed because the fabric kept snagging on your calluses.

* I wish you took your dental hygiene more seriously. I think your lax attitude and seeing you lose a lot of your teeth didn't set the best example for my sister while we were growing up.

**EDIT - did not expect Gold, yikes!** I realize closing with a comment about my Dad's flossing habits is kind of lame but it was stream of consciousness.

She was of course pretty shocked by the request and said ""are you sure? I promise you really, really don't want to smell it, I always make sure to hold my breath if I'm getting that close"" but he insisted and it was arranged.

The worst I’ve seen (just garbage, not counting stuff brought to the hazmat department):

- a freezer stuffed with a skinned, rotting, headless deer carcass. We nearly called the cops before we realized it wasn’t human.

- Used needles. The worst being a tie between “porcupine couch” and the lady who literally handed me a *paper bag* full of syringes she found during a park cleanup.

- large container of old crystallized picric acid. Bomb squad had to deal with that one.

The best:

- a high end laptop in perfect condition except for a tiny crack on the lcd panel. Easy DIY repair that took $40 and 5 minutes, thing would’ve cost $1.5K new

- enough brand new furniture to literally furnish my whole apartment 

- a high end military grade inflatable boat, brand new 

The weirdest:

- a 1st gen platelet counting machine, complete with weird tubes of bright green liquid and mercury. When I was prepping it for hazmat disposal I had to call the company that bought the company that made it for some info... they never digitized the records but the oldest repair tech still working was super excited because he remembered servicing them 50 years ago.

- coffin. No body, just the coffin. Couldn’t see anything wrong with it either.

- buckets of testicles (from a ranch) that had been sitting out in the summer heat for a week. Smelled so bad my coworker hurled. That’s not the weird part... the weird part is the guys *wanted their buckets back.* Do you know how bad it has to smell to make a garbage collector puke? And they wanted them back?!

- the $10k duffel bag. Lady came in super upset because earlier she threw out a duffel bag that she didn’t know her boyfriend kept cash in. Over $10,000 in cash. We never found the bag.

- 16 full size barrels of old vegetable grease some guy had saved up in his garage. He was planning to make a biodiesel car or something.

Edit: a lot of people are asking if we get to keep stuff. Officially, no. It’s not against the law as far as I know (except for illegal stuff like drugs), but it’s against our policy. However workers do salvage things... as long as it’s discreet and they’re not selling it, management doesn’t get involved. Selling stuff is a big no.

We don’t fight over stuff. In fact we’ll keep an eye out for things colleagues might need. Most of what we salvage is actually tools and stuff we use at the dump. I’ve also started a management approved program to give away free household products that would otherwise be hazardous waste (paint, oil, cleaners, etc). Some dumps also run thrift stores to divert materials from landfill, but we don’t have the space.",30539

This is a *massive* simplification (bc the full explanation is super complicated), but in the US punishments must be clearly delineated (eg not arbitrary) in the statute and based on the crime itself, not on the perpetrator her/himself.  And to be clear - a judge has discretion to waive/reduce/etc due to hardship, but it really doesn't work the other way (eg, a judge can give you the 'max' but s/he can't just arbitrarily tack on a punishment higher that the statute permits b/c you are rich.)

EDIT to add: getting way too many replies to answer ppl, but here is something to think about: The 8th amendment plus the 14th amendment together prohibit punishments that are 'arbitrary.'  This means that when you are punished for a crime, there has to be a set penalty in place. This means that if two people commit the *exact* same crime under the *exact* same circumstance in the *exact* same jurisdiction, they would get the *exact* same punishment.  If a punishment was based on your income, you'd get two different outcomes - this is why these laws get tossed.  There's a famous quote I'm butchering that goes something like 'justice can never be served by the roll of the dice,' meaning different outcome for different people in identical situations isn't justice.

Another thing to consider - your income itself is *also* arbitrary.  On monday you're unemployed; the next day you take your last dollar and win the lottery; if you got a ticket monday, the punishment is $0 on tuesday your punishment is $$$$$ - with no change in the law itself; that's too arbitrary in the eyes of the law.  There are also several other challenges in the way of income-based fines, but the 8th plus 14th amendments are the big ones.

Final edit: there's a ton of ""but in Germany..."" or ""but in finland...""  or ""if it works in Europe, it can work here."" Other countries can do whatever they want; in the US we are bound by the US Constitution - there's not a lot of wiggle room short of 1) passing an amendment, or 2) pushing through a whole new interpretation of several amendments and getting a whole shit load of precedent reversed.

- breath in and out so deeply you feel like your ribs are being pulled apart and knitted back together. 

- Grab something near you, could be a pole, table whatever, and clench and unclench around it. 

- Walk, while counting your steps. 

- Do something rhythmic, I like bouncing a ball personally but can be anything, from using a stamp to skipping. 

All research shows when you reach ""red mist"" your rationality is gone and you just have to last it out. Your best bet is to recognise when you're losing control and utilise grounding techniques before you're past the point of no return.

One summer, because I was hella bored, I bought some chef Boyardee beefaroni and put it in my friend's mailbox as a prank. He didn't find it but his parents did, and they asked their neighbors who did it. He suspected me at first, but I managed to get him off of my tail. Now our neighborhoods were fairly close to eachother, so I could be over there in a 50 minute walk. Every night, I walked up to their neighborhood (walking anywhere at 2:am is creepy as hell but the Boyardee bandit does not stop for demons) and put a can of beefaroni inside their mailbox. After about a month, they call the police to find out who's putting beefaroni in their mailbox. Luckily the police really didn't care that much and just told them to get a camera which they eventually did. Meanwhile my friend is telling me all of this from his perspective, right, so I usually know what they do before I strike. So I start covering my face, and pretend to hunch over. I have no idea where this camera is, so I can never be too careful. They call the cops again and give them a profile, and now the cops are looking for a crippled beefaroni bandit. After a solid 3 months of this shit, one of the baggers at the store gets word somehow, and starts getting suspicious because he sees me buying tons of beefaroni. He confronts me, I tell him the truth, and I shit you not he starts helping me beefaroni my friend's house. We're putting it all over hiding it in the lawns, porch, fence, you name it. Halloween rolls around, and I dress up as chef Boyardee. I go to my friends house and say ""your daily subscription to Chef Boyardee beefaroni has ended. Would you like to renew?"". I hear laughter in the background, and it's the store clerk. Turns out he recently started dating best friend's sister, and that's how he heard. Truth be told, I don't think I've ever been punched harder than when my friend found out. Good times. We still laugh about it from time to time.

I was coaching a soccer team and had a kid in the foster program on the team. He was 13. Over the course of the season my wife and I really got to know him and saw how shitty his foster parents were. At the end of the season we asked him if he wanted to come live with us instead. It’s been 9 years since then. 

We had rough patches, but for us it was easy. We were still a young couple (24 & 27) then but his social worker arranged continued funding for us which eliminated any financial burden. It was an easy decision for us and I’d do it again in a heart beat. We’ve had 4 of his other biological siblings live with us at one time or another as they’ve aged out of foster care. They all have their own unique problems, but all kids do. His 18 year old sister asked to come quarantine with us so we’ve got her staying here now. His brothers and sister are all just extra family and our biological little ones (3 & 5) call them all brother/sister. 

He’s 22 now and almost done with college and hopes to be a police officer. Sadly my wife and I will be moving out of state soon and we’ll miss him like crazy, but know we’ve prepared him for life outside our home. We’ll still be there for him of course, but we’re excited to see him thrive independently.

2799,Who are the 5 celebrities most likely to die in 2019?,"My list (not in order)

1. *Queen Elizabeth* - 92 years old, she's had a list of surgeries in the past year and I'm convinced those hats she wears are somehow magically responsible for holding her body together. Prince Harry is going to have a child in like seven months and I think once she meets her grandchild then she'll probably call it quits. 


2. *Kirk Douglas* - 101 years old. He's probably slept with more women in his life than you or I will ever even meet and he was motherfucking Spartacus. And he's been married for 60 years. Those add up to a live well lived in my eyes. He's got nothing left to prove. 


3. *Bob Dole* - 94 years old. Bob is a cool guy. He tried for the presidency but lost. He had a successful career as a politician was a decorated soldier as well. He's the oldest living republican and I think Trump will do something in 2019 that finally makes him say ""fuck this, I'm out.""


4. *Betty White* - 96 years old. I don't like this one because Betty White is a fucking OG but I think this will be the year. Upon turning 96, she said ""I have no plans to retire at 96"" and I believe she will keep her word. She will never retire but she will die before she gets the chance to. 



5. *Pete Davidson* - 25 years old. This one makes me sad. I like Pete Davidson. He's morbidly funny and truly seems like he does not give a fuck. But comedians are infamous for actually being miserable and I think Pete falls into that category. His dad died in 9/11, he recently basically said ""I don't want to live any more"" and all that shit with the Ariana Grande had to have taken its toll. Sadly, I think he will kill himself.

1.  Because the pornography is illegal, it is difficult to come by.  Sites vanish overnight, so if someone finds material they like, they can't count on it ever being there again.  So they download it.

2.  Many services that allow download of this  sort of thing demand upload of similar content in return (kind of like seeding your torrents).  The pornography becomes a form of currency; the more you have, the more you can get.

3.  Some sites demand *original* content, so some of the people arrested are involved in production.

2815,"When i was a kid I hit my head so hard, I tasted a flavor. Is there an explanation for my brain damage induced flavor?","Basically I crammed my body into a long skinny box. I some how ended up in a position where I was standing helpless, with barely any foot room to walk, and arms glued by my sides.

With only my head sticking out, my friend decided to kick the box over. I fell directly backwards on a very steep driveway which added some extra force to the fall. My head smacked that cement so fucking hard. The first thing I noticed was a bizarre taste in my mouth, unlike anything I ever tasted. The closest thing I can describe the taste to is wet cement, pennies, and something else. (Something else being the part I can't describe, but this was the most distinct part of the taste)

Afterwards, I flashed in and out of consciousness whilst getting rushed to the hospital. Get this, I hit my head so hard, I forgot what people looked liked. Not specific people, but *fucking people*. Aside from the taste thing, I recall this most vividly. I remember seeing these bald gangly creatures all around me, and my brain couldn't make the connection on what the hell these things were, I couldn't tell if they were people, as I couldn't remember what people looked like.

 My mom told me years later that she also recalled me freaking out asking questions like ""what do people look like. What do people look like!!"" Whilst I was being rushed to the ER, and being told not to go to sleep.

 yes I have permanent brain damage.

Edit: I should have given more context this is my bad, I definitely didn't taste blood, I wasn't bleeding within my mouth, throat or tongue.

There's be no military personnel at the perimeter, no gates they couldn't climb over, nothing. They'd be like ""now what?"" and collectively decide to keep advancing. A couple of Humvees would appear on the ridgeline, a couple of staff sergeants would get out and peer through binoculars at them, the crowd would get a bit tense and start to wonder if they're about to get shot, but the mob mentality would keep them advancing. Staff sergeant determines there's no threat here, puts his binoculars in away, gets back in the humvee and drives away. The confusion among the mob starts to increase, wondering why they're not met with the hostility and resistance they had so much anticipated.

&#x200B;

They'd march their way through long barren desert roads, past surveillance cameras, but no people.

&#x200B;

Eventually they'd reach a manned check-point and the hostility of the mob would start to increase again anticipating resistance from the military. Instead they'd be greeted with ""Oh we've been waiting for you guys, wondered when you'd show up... come on in"". The gate would open and they'd be allowed to freely walk through. The mob is now getting more and more confused and disoriented, they never expected to get this far. They're now in the mindset of a Jehova's Witness who's actually been invited into the house of the door they just knocked on. They're there to talk about Jesus but they don't know what to say beyond that point. They keep walking.

&#x200B;

Finally they reach the gate. Fortified, blast-proof walls topped with razor wire and machine gun turrets extend out as far as the eye can see. A high ranking officer steps out, greets them warmly with a twinkle in his eye before saying ""You wanna see the aliens?"" The mob is now anxious, they never expected to get this far but fuck yeah they want to see the aliens, but first they have to go for a ""briefing"" and since there are so many of them they can only be accommodated in one of the huge aeroplane hangers. They drop their pickets and banners, and pile into a long line of personnel wagons which drive them across the base, getting a guided tour past the stealth bombers and other top secret projects, and pull up at the hanger. They all jump down from the wagons and gather inside the hanger. The doors slide shut behind them, the lights go down. The buzz and conversation among the mob slowly quietens down...

Then the gas comes on and they all die.

2833,Worst historical times to be alive?,"In my opinion being a child in the 1932-1933 Ukrainian famine. It is known as the Holodomor. The communist induced famine killed up to 3.9 million people between 1932-33 in Ukraine Alone. The collectivized harvest of 1930 was bountiful and provided a quota that the coming years could never possibly meet. This is the result:

\- Mothers would lock their children in cottages to protect them from the roving bands of cannibals. Other parents sent their children away in the hope that they could be saved by others. Parents would give their children away to distant families or to strangers, or leave them at train stations. The desperate mother's would hold their babies up to train windows, not to beg, but in the hopes that they would be taken in by someone aboard the train (who was likely from the city and therefore not about to starve to death).

\- Mothers telling their children to eat them when they die. ""Mother says we should eat her if she dies.""

\- Countless accounts of parents eating their children. Families would kill the weakest member.

\- Death at a rate of more than 10,000 a day from starvation

\- People dropping dead from starvation while waiting in the massive lines for a measly amount of bread. ""People appeared at 2 o'clock in the morning to queue in front of shops that did not open until 7. On an average day 40,000 people would wait for bread. Those in line were so desperate to keep their places that they would cling to the belts of those immediately in front of them.... The waiting lasted all day, and sometimes for two.... Somewhere in line a woman would wail, and the moaning would echo up and down the line, so that the whole group of thousands sounded like a single animal with an elemental fear."" One women begged herself to the front of the line, clearly on the verge of death. Upon forcing herself into a shop, the shopkeeper shot her dead.

\-""Hanna Sobolewska, who lost her father and five brothers and sisters to starvation, remembered her younger brother Jozef's painful hope. Even as he swelled from hunger he kept finding signs of life. One day he though he could see crops rising from the ground; on another he believed he had found mushrooms. ""Now we will live!"" he would exclaim, and repeat these words before he went to sleep each night. Then one morning he awoke and said: ""Everything dies.""""

\-School children would first write to the authorities, in the hope that the starvation was a result of the misunderstanding. One class of elementary school students sent a letter to party authorities asking ""for your help, since we are falling down from hunger. We should be learning, but we are too hungry to walk.""

\- Houses that had smoke rising from their chimneys would be investigated for cannibalism (that's how prevalent it was). Anyone selling meat was investigated and a close eye was kept by the authorities on slaughterhouses and butchers that may be abusing the circumstances.

\- People crawling to the graveyard to dig their own graves and then proceeded to lie in them and wait to die. ""Petro veldii showed rare strength when he dragged himself through his village on the day he expected to die. The other villagers asked him where was going: to the cemetery to lay himself down. He did not want strangers coming and dragging his body away to a pit. So he had dug his own grave, but by the time he reached the cemetery another body had filled it. He dug himself another one, lay(ed) down and waited.""

\- Since many would trek to the cities in order to beg, there were many instances of babies seen suckling the breast of the lifeless grey corpse of their mother. A single city dweller could witness this same scene multiple times.

\- Healthier peasants would form burial brigades would sometimes take the weak alongside the dead for burial (since they were paid per corpse). They would talk with such people along the way and explain that they were going to die soon anyway so what difference would it make? In some cases the weak would dig themselves out of the shallow mass graves, since the grave diggers would be too weak to burry them deep. Eventually those apart of the burial crews would starve as well and wild dogs would eat their corpses.

\- A journalist (Gareth Jones) made the illegal trip to Ukraine. He trampled through the countryside with a backpack full of food. He slept on dirty floors with starving children and saw the famine for himself. In one instance he shared his food with a little girl and she exclaimed: ""Now that I have eaten such wonderful things I can die happy.""

\- Yosyp Panasenko (Ukrainian musician) was dispatched by central authorities with his troupe of bandura players to provide culture to the starving peasants. Even as the state took the last of their food, it had the grotesque inclination to elevate the minds and rouse the spirits of the dying. They found village after village completely abandoned. When they finally came across some people: two girls dead in a bed, two legs of a man protruding from the stove and an old lady raving and running her fingernails through the dirt.

\- A women doctor wrote to her friend in June 1933 that she had not yet become a cannibal, but was ""not sure that I shall not be one by the time my letter reaches you.""

\- In one village the women tried to form a sort of orphanage. The orphanage was in pitiful condition. ""The children had bulging stomachs, covered in wounds, in scabs; their bodies were bursting. We took them outside, we put them on sheets, and they moaned. One day the children suddenly fell silent, we turned around to see what was happening, and they were eating the smallest child little Petrus. They were tearing strips from him and eating him. And Petrus was doing the same, he was tearing strips from himself and eating them, he ate as much as he could. The other children put their lips to his wounds and drank his blood. We took the child away from the hungry mouths and we cried.""

\- Children recruited to watchtowers that surrounded the fields to report on their family members if they were taking any grain for themselves. Half a million preadolescent and young teenage boys and girls stood in the watchtowers observing adults in 1933.

\- Entire villages becoming wiped out with not a single person surviving leaving a chilling silence behind in the country side.

\- Collective farms that could not meet their quotas were required immediately to surrender fifteen times the amount of grain that was normally due in a month. No village could meet their quota. This resulted in the authorities searching everywhere and confiscating any food they found, including potatoes in the gardens, seeds for next years crops and even supper that was on the stove. It didn't matter they took everything. Soviet youth brigades would go village to village, exclaiming ""Peasant! Peasant! Where is your grain? Confess!"" They took everything resembling food that they could find and ate it, along with humiliating the peasants. They would urinate in barrels of pickles, make starving peasants box each other for amusement and make them crawl and bark like dogs.

\- Grain left to rot in storehouses that were guarded by the NKVD. Any food relief or donations raised by Ukrainians living in Poland, or organizations abroad, was denied categorically.

\- Rape and robbery by authorities was widespread under the guise of grain confiscation.

\- When farm animals that were not seized would die, crowds of villagers would follow the veterinarian to the burial pit for a chance at a piece of the corpses. The veterinarian would douse the corpse with chemicals to make it inedible and yet the people still jumped at the corpse in a furious frenzy hacked off what ever they could.

I think that this Ukrainian children's song from the time sums it up perfectly:

""Father Stalin, look at this

Collective farming is just bliss

The hut's in ruins, the barn's all sagged

All the horses broken nags

And on the hut a hammer and sickle

And in the hut death and famine

No cows left, no pigs at all

Just your picture on the wall

Daddy and mommy are in the kolkhoz (form of collective farm)

There's endless horrifying details about this period I cannot even begin to summarize all of the suffering. What's even more terrible is that many of the survivors that had to endure this terrible existence would later end up in Gulags or even just sentenced to death for their nationality or social class on mass. If you survived that: there was a good chance you would die in world war 2. Death was extremely slow and excruciating. This is what happens when you use food as a weapon.

When Stalin's wife heard details of this, she killed herself by shooting herself through the heart on the anniversary of the October Revolution. Which subsequently made Stalin (somehow) even more brutal and heartless.

2836,Am I going to be turned into a skin suit??,"So I have this friend who's always been kinda awkward.... like just socially awkward .. but recently he started doing some weird sh*t. He showed up at my house unannounced and knocked on the door softer than usual, my boyfriend was home and wasn't even sure he heard a knock, so he gets up to walk to the door and this guy's coming in and almost looks startled to see my boyfriend. My boyfriend tells him I'm at work and he quickly tells my boyfriend that he had messaged me and I told him to go hang out at my house (I didn't nor had I received any messages from this guy that day). So my boyfriend tells him that he's going to pick me up from work and this guy tries to insist he does it instead.. my boyfriend says he's got it... anyways we humored him and hung out with him the rest of the night.

So now a few weeks later he messages me and I ignore it because I just don't wanna hang out that weekend, and THIS GUY SHOWS UP AT MY HOUSE UNANNOUNCED AND JUST HANGS OUT?? I'm just genuinely kinda rubbed wrong by the whole thing and mildly creeped out... not sure if it's just my anxiety for this guy is giving me legit serial killer vibes. The last time I got a feeling like this, it was when I almost walked into a now known serial killers house and decided against it...

TL;DR I think my friend wants to murder me but it's based off of a gut feeling from a collective of small creepy things he has done.

""When an adult is raped by a juvenile, the offense of statutory rape imposes criminal liability on the adult for the same intercourse by which the adult is a victim of rape. In this way, the offense of statutory rape criminalizes being raped; it criminalizes being the victim of rape. It criminalizes the failure to prevent or resist being raped by a juvenile. And neither defenses specific to statutory rape nor defenses of general application satisfactorily preclude liability.""

If you survive all of that, though, it will eventually dry into a lump perfectly molded into the shape of your anus with no way to get it out except incredibly invasive surgery.

All their evolutions are all part of animals being able to survive and ensure their descendants survive as well, what I’m getting at is, it appears that survival is something that should be ingrained in our instincts, like our fear based reactions to dangerous situations. I can’t help but wonder, is suicide going against survival instincts? Is it a complex human flaw because we are too self aware as opposed to animals who probably wouldn’t recognize their own reflection?

People who have a more fluid gender for instance also tend to have small changes in behavior, including the way they walk and talk, without them noticing it.

Gender dysphoria however is a mental illness. The dysphoria is part of being transgender, and it's the part that comes with feeling in the wrong body. It can actually have severe effects on people, including self mutilation and suicide. Most of the time the gender dysphoria goes away after transitioning, but parts can stay behind, definitely when there are people purposefully misgendering them.

The area around the school shooting, such as the block, would likely be quarantined and blocked off while the investigation is ongoing. After first responders and the ambulance has left with any survivors and statements are taken, the school is probably completely evacuated so investigators can photograph the scene and collect evidence.

After that, the bodies would be taken to a morgue, cleaned up and identified by family members while any trace of blood, flesh, and signs of struggle would be removed where the shooting occured by a forensics type cleaning company that specializes in bio hazardous waste.

The school would likely close for at least a week out of respect as things like funerals, vigils, etc would be held. Some students might stay out of school longer and attend therapy as needed. Staff would be reasonably shaken as well so some teachers might decide to ask for a substitute.

Alternatively, what voodoo/alternative health ritual is this scenario? 
This question and what this substance was has bothered  me for years and let me tell you (it's a bit of a story):

So, I come a not so great family on both sides. My dad's side was a crazy mix of super conservative Catholics and weird superstitious/voodoo/occult believers who also believed in alternative health. 

My aunt on that side of the family did this back businesses out of one of her spare rooms offering alternative medicine. I don't know what it was, I was too young to fully understand. But people with like bone and pain issues would come to her for help, I guess?

One day without prompt she sat me down at the dining table and put a crystal teacup in front of me. Inside it was filled with a beige substance. It was thick. And it had weird chunks of color in it. Like yellows, reds, oranges, whites. To be honest, it looked like throw up. 

I couldn't have been more than 11. I got forcefully held down by my dad and someone else, while this vile substance in this tea cup was shoved into my mouth. It was the worst smell you could ever imagine. I will never forget that smell. It was the worst taste you could ever imagine, and I still gag thinking about it. It was warm and cold at the same time. It was chunky and honestly it felt like throw up in my mouth. It felt like I was throwing up backwards as this shit was being forcefully fed to me. 

Something was in it, because I vomited like the exorcist afterwards. It was awful. I quite literally thought I was going to die. I wasn't religious, but in between moments of clarity I remember asking the Lord for help. 

They also forcefully  held a towel up to my mouth and eventually in my mouth. So all the vomit that would come up would be forced to go back down. It really didn't. I vomited and heaved so hard that it forced the towel out and they would have the shove it back in. I remember something about something bad being expelled. Or that I had to drink this and I couldn't throw it up? So that's why they shoved a towel all the way in the back of my mouth. I'm not sure.

I can only speak for animals since I am a veterinarian, but when we remove eyes, we remove the eyelid margins and all the muscles surrounding the eyeball itself plus and conjunctiva. The skin is closed in a simple interrupted pattern, all the adnexa is removed so there is no tear formation after the eye is gone. 

This is for full enucleation, but if you just remove the globe and replace it with an artificial eye, I would imagine leaving all the tear gland tissue in there will retain tear production. 

If I see an animal that has had an injury to the eye to cause it to shrivel up and become a big glob of scar tissue, the lid margins will remain as well as tear glands causing tears and mucus to accumulate in the socket around the shriveled up eye. Due to the fact that these are just gross and diminish the human-animal bond, anything like this is usually removed. You also have to consider that there may be some pain associated with a small scarred eye if enough cornea is present to feel pain of an eyelash rubbing it. 

If you just cut an eye out and left the hole without closing the wound, eventually scar tissue would slowly creep in from the edge and cover the wounded area. Tear production may occur depending on how much of the eyelid tissue is left.",746

2973,How come when children/teens kill animals it’s a red flag for them being a sociopath/serial killer but when adults pay to kill wild animals for trophy’s nothing is thought of it?,"Don’t you think it would still apply? And yes — i know, theyre usually killing the sick/old/injured animals... but they’re still taking pride in it are they not? they still feel some type of satisfaction right? who’s to say they aren’t capable of doing the same to a person? 

Edit: I just want to clarify: i’m simply asking why adults aren’t thought of as possibly being a sociopath/serial killer like kids and adolescents are? They’re still taking pride in killing. 

Edit #2: I’m not talking about hunting. i’m not talking about hunters who keep the meat and skin and actually utilize the dead animal. I’m talking about adults who pay to kill an animal, don’t keep the meat or skin, just taking pride in killing and keeping the head up on the wall. i don’t have anything against hunting if you’re utilizing the animal, i’m not some vegan trying to preach, i’m just a curious girl lol. 

sorry if this isn’t morbid. but i’m curious and don’t know where else to ask, if you guys know then kindly direct me to the sub and i’ll delete this post :) ",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x30f16d350>,1542005364.0,"First of all, children killing animals isn't necessarily a red flag by itself. It's not uncommon for a kid to stomp on a squirrel or something like that and then feel awful about it after. A lot of that is power tripping and a lot of that is curiosity, neither of which are by themselves indicative of psychopathy, because a young child doesnt know better. It becomes a red flag when the child is doing it out if cruelty/sadism - doing it just to cause pain. Or, if they're old enough to where they fully understand why they're doing it and why they shouldn't be doing it. In that case, they're probably doing it out of cruelty, which is a problem.

Second of all, a lot of it comes down to motivation. When a hunter tracks and kills a deer, you might call him an asshole, but he did it for the difficulty of it and the challenge, not because he really wanted to shoot a deer. If you just grab a deer and tie it up in front of a regular hunter they wouldn't gleefully jump at the opportunity to kill it, because that's not the point of hunting. If you kill animals just because you like killing them, then yeah, that's messed up. I think most people would agree to that. But there's always gonna be pride in accomplishing something difficult. That's why an animal carcass is referred to as a ""prize"" - it's something you earned. As for why it wouldn't apply to humans, the simple answer is that we just don't care as much about animals as we do humans. We take far less issue with killing them, and happily eat them every day. It's kinda like asking, if we like eating meat so much, who's to say we don't one day try to snack on some human flesh? It's just not how our brains are wired. Some people have messed up wiring, and that's why a child (or adult) killing an animal out of pure cruelty is a red flag. It's indicative of that damaged wiring.

I’ve been suicidal a few times and with the help of my husband and therapy and medicine, I know I would’ve made a devastating mistake if I had gone through with my plans. 

We used to have gas ovens, which made it easy for people to kill themselves by turning the ovens on, sticking their heads inside, and killing themselves by inhaling the gas. When the ovens were changed to make them safer, the suicide rate dropped dramatically. This was used to prove the theory that the suicidal feeling was temporary and that if people found it harder to kill themselves, they wouldn’t do it. 

For people who are suicidal, we urge them to find someone to help them through this temporary period. However, having suffered through depression most of my life, I know how crippling and painful it is and I know that not all depression responds to treatment. 

I’m one of the lucky ones whose depression is able to be mostly controlled with medication and therapy, but I have been through hell and back. 

For someone who is living with full-blown depression and nothing is working to get them out of it, I would completely understand if they told me to fuck off if I told them to seek help.

3043,"If we were to kill every human being with HIV, would we get rid of the disease?",Just an ignorant and morbid shower thought.,morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x31276f090>,1590490738.0,"To answer the spirit of your question, yes, if every human infected with HIV were killed, the virus would be effectively eradicated in the human population, however, we would not be completely rid of the virus.

There were approximately [37.9 million people across the globe with HIV/AIDS in 2018.](https://www.who.int/hiv/data/en/)

It's also worth mentioning that [HIV Life Expectancy in U.S. Now Matches General Population—With Some Big “Buts.”](https://www.thebodypro.com/article/hiv-life-expectancy-in-u-s-matches-general-population-with-some-differences)

To answer your question specifically, more nuance is required.  While HIV is a virus that may cause an infection, AIDS (which is short for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) is a condition. Contracting HIV can lead to the development of AIDS.  AIDS, or stage 3 HIV, develops when HIV has caused serious damage to the immune system.  As such, every person with AIDS has HIV, but not every person with HIV has AIDS.  Semantically, AIDS is the disease, and HIV is the virus that causes it.

If all humans with HIV were killed, the virus could theoretically still be passed from non-human primates to humans. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is a species of retrovirus that cause persistent infections in at least 45 species of African non-human primates. SIVsmm in sooty mangabeys and SIVcpz in chimpanzees, are believed to have crossed the species barrier into humans, resulting in HIV-2 and HIV-1 respectively, the two human immunodeficiency viruses.

Furthermore, there are undoubtedly tens of thousands of HIV samples in laboratories around the world.  Even if every human infected with HIV were killed, the virus could potentially propagate again if one of the samples were used to unknowingly or deliberately infect someone.

Lastly, people with HIV that take antiretroviral treatment (ART) may have an undetectable HIV viral load.  An undetectable viral load is where ART has reduced someone's HIV to such small quantities that it can no longer be detected by standard blood tests.  Consequently, it would be extremely difficult to identify a HIV positive person that uses ART, which would make identifying and killing them rather challenging.",713

In Stephen King’s “The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,” the protagonist comes down with pneumonia and a bad stomach infection of some kind after being lost for days and drinking bad water. 

The narration specifically explains that eventually she felt relief from all the diarrhea and vomiting because she is so sick that her body just gives up and quits trying to fight off the illness.

Now, I’ve never been sick beyond having a very bad flu that lasted a couple weeks, but I could tell that my body was far from throwing in the towel.

My memory kind of goes by in frames. They are more of sensations and emotions rather than full of detail. I do remember I had a rough childhood.

I just remember it being ""terrible"". Why was it terrible? I couldn't tell you.

An example: I went to Disney World 10 years ago when I was in sixth grade. I had really good times with my family in some parts. But overall, we were miserable. That trip to Disney world was ""awful"". Why? A fight or something. Who knows? 

In the end, I have grown up to be a pretty well adjusted adult. My parents still bicker, but their relationship has overall improved. (No, they most absolutely won't divorce. We have had this discussion thousands of times.) They're getting along and the last few years of being in and out of college and grad school has made me really happy.

However, I can comment on things I've picked up on and hope they answer your question at least partially. Smells are very difficult to describe but I'll do my best!

If someone dies with high levels of alcohol in their system, i.e. they were very drunk when they died, you can smell this inside the body cavity. It's hard to describe, but kind of like fermenting fruit, it's a boozy tinge to the smell of meat; you can smell it straight away when you're removing the bowels.

(Now apologies if this is obvious!) if someone has eaten a huge meal just before they died, their stomach will be extremely full and this stomach contents has a revolting smell. This is because it is vomit, really, so I guess maybe if someone was a very big eater, you can often pick this up from meaty smells when you're removing the stomach as often when you are holding the stomach, gas can escape and this results in a meaty puff of air.

If someone is quite fat, then their body will have a higher water content and they are more likely to undergo a wet decomposition process. I cannot even begin to describe the smell of this, it is beyond words. The closest I could say is like really, really bad bins, mixed with rotting chicken, but mix it with faeces and multiply it by 10. It's a horrible smell that sticks to you all day in your hair, in your nostrils, underneath your fingernails (somehow? We wear gloves and yet you can smell it for hours after on your hands!)

On the other hand, a slim body is likely to mummify, especially in dry and hot conditions. A mummified body smells extremely similarly to fish sauce and dog chews (the ones that are like beef jerky).

Another point on smells is that bad diets will often manifest in the faeces. I remember a case where the deceased ""consumed only cigarettes and Jaffa cakes"" the Coroner's report said. I have never before seen such constipation and impacted faeces. To attempt to explain, the rectum is supposed to be around 1.5 - 2 inches in width. This person's rectum was so full of faeces that couldn't pass that it was around the size of a large grapefruit. And I am not exaggerating.

(I know you were asking about lifestyle and habits, but another point on the smells may interest you: if someone is just beginning to decompose, their abdomen will swell due to a gas buildup. When you cut the skin, the pressure means that a jet of this gas will escape with a hiss, and this smells extremely like rotten eggs.)

EDIT: thank you very much for the award! It says healthcare hero and that's honestly made my day. We do this job for the deceased and their families, so even to have a Reddit award is a lovely bit of acknowledgement. Thank you! 

Again, thank you very much for the awards, this is very kind and unexpected; I'm touched! Glad you got so much pleasure from reading about the smells in a mortuary!",1595

3089,How wrong is it to watch porn featuring pornstar who has committed suicide because of her job?,"Active pornstars, especially on social media, daily express their joy of working in porn industry, how getting paid for having sex is something they have always dreamed of and state their undying hornyness and ""need for dick"" to fans. Most people don't realize it's an act. And most times, it's advertising under contract, as porn stars have to promote their material and build the image of a highly desirable female object.

On the other hand, there's a significant number of retired pornstars who openly state how working in porn industry has been the worst experience of their life but they had no other means to support themselves at the time (i.e. lost their ""normal"" job and couldn't pay rent) so they had to do it. Taking your clothes off in front of bunch of strangers in order to have sex with a stranger and be recorded for the whole world to see is as tough as it sounds. But when you add to account those strangers will sometimes (more commonly than you know) mistreat you, either professionally or sexually, force you to do things you are disgusted of, give you chlamydia, gonorrhea or other urinary infection... You get why most pornstars are either on anti-depressants or doing drugs.

Those most popular and beloved ones, the ones we think of when we say ""pornstars"", are the ones who succeeded. They manged to rise up the ranks so they can choose jobs, pick partners and producers themselves, and even then, all of them tend to build their own site so they could be their own boss and avoid working with anyone who might possibly  mistreat them.

August Ames committed suicide last year, two days after online bullying when she openly refused to shoot a scene with a guy who does gay porn, her reasons having nothing to do with homophobia but being purely health concerned, since gay porn doesn't hold to the same health standards as ""regular"" porn.

3112,"if a child is taught that their is only one gender, how would that affect their sexuality once they reach that age?","i will be honest, i am not entirely certain this is a morbid question on its own. the situation i am about to suggest might qualify though. 

the experiment is this.

first, groups of like gendered infants are separated from their parents. preferably this is done at birth to limit as much possible interation as possible. this is to control and eliminate variables. males would be grouped with other males and isolated from females and visa versa.

these children are raised in what is essentially a normal nursery  apart from one thing. the nurses are only allowed to outwardly appear as male for the males and female for the females. their gender identity does not matter so long as they agree to only appear as the correct one depending on which test subjects they interact with.

these childeren will be raised as normally as can be expected given the circumstances. entertainment will be monitered for any mention of genders and altered should need be. i imagine most visual entertainment would be eliminated as editing tv shows comics and movies would not be viable for these purposes. 

education would be the normal standards for children baring biology. they would learn math, science, and language skills. likely english as it is the language i know and i know it is possible to ignore genders which would be integrated into other languages such as spanish.

the care givers would not be allowed to socialize with the childeren in any manner aside from education. they are not meant to be friends and must remain entirely neutral to all situations. stop arguments and any physical altercations, but otherwise remain as outsiders.

in the event that a child reaches a cognitive level where they question where they came from a story shall be fabricated about being created for being observed.

eventually the childeren will reach sexual maturity. this is when the reall results of the experiment would be observed. no inteference must come from the care givers. all questions regarding changing bodies or strange feelings must be ignored. the childeren must be allowed to discover for themselves what they wish to do and how they handle their changing bodies.

i doubt we have had any experiments done like this so i am sure there is no answer, but what are your hypotheses as to what would happen?

basically the question that i believe this experiment would solve is, how much of an influence does society have on sexuality.  we already know that sexuality is not a choice. if you are born gay, you are gay, but in a world where there isn't the option to be straight and you don't even have a concept of being straight, what would the effects be?

my personal theory is that in this situation, the childeren would eventually discover masturbation. they know they would feel good, but being that they have no concept of gender, the act would be purely physical. i don't think any of them would attempt to have sex with each other and if they did, it would be no different in their minds to normal play. this would be a society where no taboos of sexuality exist so the act is only based on pleasure. the thought process would be, it feels good so i am going to keep doing this.",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x315ad6c50>,1557662859.0,"Read up about Dr. Kohn Money and his experiment with David Reimer. For years it was called the John/Joan case to protect David’s identity. 

Short version:
Money believed gender is learned not born into. David suffers a botched circumcision and Money convinced his parents to raise him as a girl. Money claimed it was a success but David never felt right as a girl and realized by about age 9 he was meant to be a boy. Money did some sick experiments on him and his twin brother. David eventually committed suicide. 

When I was in college we watched a documentary on the case as part of a class in documentary film. We studied it as a question of ethics in documentary. This was before David had killed himself(the only reason I know it was prior to his death is I graduated in 2001 and he killed himself in 2004). I don’t recall the name of the documentary off hand. But I’ve also seen this covered on news programs around the time of his death. Also, both David and Dr. Money have pages on Wikipedia. 

This case is the closest experiment you’ll find in the question I believe you’re trying to answer.",518

All of this with muffled screaming and heavy breathing. when they removed his head with a quick twist of the spine when all the meat was removed.. his neck hole started puking from the stump and it shot out like 3 feet in several bursts. You can hear the gagging but it sounded different. I could still tell it was a gagging sound though. The gagging sound, the shooting puke, all with the little waterfall sound of his blood.

So once it has gotten through the ureter to the bladder, it's normally a pretty easy pass from there.

In the unlikely event that you had a stone in your urethra, it depends entirely on how stuck it is.

One mother said that her daughter has 80 seizures a day. The children featured are so cognitively impaired they're unable to process anything beyond immediate stimuli like light and touch. 

If I had a cat in that kind of condition I would take it to the vet and have it put down. That would be the compassionate choice, in my opinion, because my cat would be suffering. And I have the legal authority to do that as the pet owner. 

I understand that when it comes to humans it's impossible to establish a threshold where life stops being ""worth living"", and that it would be different for every person anyways. But in a situation where a child was truly just in pain and had no real cognitive ability (but was unlikely to die from their condition) could a parent legally euthanize their child?",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x317d425d0>,1610122266.0,[deleted],479

So first off, banks and private lenders don’t hand out $25M to just anyone. The borrower will typically put up some sort of collateral such as real estate, that is worth at least the amount borrowed, so upon the borrowers death, the lender would have some claim to that collateral in order to recoup the debt.

So yes, a borrower can just go crazy and throw the money around if that gives them joy, but they wouldn’t be getting away with anything, since they (or their estate after they die) would be out the same value of collateral anyway, once the lender realizes the debt is not going to be paid off as expected.",675

But yes. You absolutely could. Bones I'm not so sure about, though.

Consider that bulimics have bad teeth after a time. Excessive vomiting is enough to erode your enamel, which is quite a bit hardier than your skin.

Also that other guy definitely didn't drink hydrochloric acid. They drank very diluted hydrochloric acid. Concentrated HCI would have fucked up their throat and mouth. The HCI that they drank was likely quite a bit weaker than their stomach acid, else they'd have definitely felt some irritation.

Also also, consider that while your stomach uses a constant stream of mucus to protect you from its acidic content, that acidic content is there to break down organic matter like foliage or meat. YOU are meat.

Never rat anyone out. Befriend the guards only to give you a better cell with more civilized inmates if your current ones are assholes.

Tips: Usually inmates with longer sentences tend to behave better than new inmates who feel like they have something to prove. They will be there for a year or so and that makes them cocky.

Hygiene is very important! No one will like you if you stink. 

People will be bored quickly there. Have a good sense of humour. But never at the expense of someone or their outside family.

Never judge. Everyone is a sinner out there. Accusing or criticizing will only bring you troubles.

Don't stare. Some people can kill you for a perceived nasty look.

If you have a smaller build which makes you easier to be picked on start going to the gym inside the prison.

Never respond to insults. It's better to laugh at yourself. That shows you are an easy-going guy and nothing they say affects you.

If you see a fight, even if some is dying, do not involve. You have no place in separating two pit bulls. The best you can do is yell for a guard, but even that is troublesome.

If someone wants to fight you reframe the fight. Chose an arm sparring or a slapping contest. You will be surprised to find out that people will be entertained enough to see that instead of a blood bath.

Now if a fight is unavoidable start learning Krav Maga or LINE before you go to prison.

Regardless of your view on abortion, I believe that abortion should be ""safe, legal and rare"". But more importantly, I believe that we should tackle the problem at the source. And one of these sources is the fact that many women choose abortion because they unintentionally got pregnant through rape.

Based on research data, what does cause people to rape, and what is the main cause of rape?:

* Is the main cause of rape because the rapist is desperate for sex but can't find someone who would consensually have sex with them?

* Is the main cause of rape because of miscommunication (i.e. the rapist mistakenly believes that their victim is consenting)?

* Is the main cause of rape because the rapist wants to feel a sense of domination?

* Is the main cause of rape because the rapist is ordered to rape (e.g. soldiers just following orders to commit war rape)?

3194,At what point do we give up?,"My grandma has been fighting cancer for 20 years and in the past few years, it’s been particularly awful. In and out of the hospitals, treatments, treatments not working anymore, hope lost, hope gained. I can’t count the number of times a doctor has told us that she “has x amount of days to live”. but she is truly a fighter. 

but right now, it really is the end for her i believe. she’s at home right now. she hasn’t left the bed for days, she hasn’t eaten or drinkin in about 2 days. i looked up that death rattle thing and she seems to be doing it and has been for around 24 hours. 
 
my mom has been her caregiver throughout all of this. they’re immigrants so they both have lived together their whole lives. they are VERY close. every once in a while my grandmother will answer yes or no questions with a slight head nod or shake. and my mom will be so happy. she’ll say “she hears us!” my mom will bring in my little brother in to say hi and say i love you, and my grandma will give a big deep breathe, and my mom will look at me in shock. it’s heart breaking. sometimes i’ll hear my mom whisper to my grandma “keep fighting” “we’ll get through this” while my grandma just lays there, eyes closed, and moaning and groaning. my mom has literally given up the past year of her life to stay at home and care for my grandma ever since our doctors had given up. then my mom told me about a story of this guy who had cancer, drank only water for a month, and all of his cancer disappeared. and she asked me “do you think grandma has a chance doing that?” i didn’t even know what to say... i feel so pained to see my mom like this. 

it is kind of surprising that my grandma has stayed alive through not eating or drinking for this long, basically just consuming liquid morphine and anxiety meds and occasional drips of water. our visiting nurse also said that her heart is very healthy despite her blood pressure lowering. the nurse basically said though yesterday that her body will be slowly shutting down til death within the day. and she said that 24 hours ago. my mom will feel her heart and it will be beating super hard. my mom has gone through immense amount of stress and has cried more than she has over the course of her whole life.

3210,What remedy does the Code of Hammurabi provide for deliberate misuse of a Home Depot display toilet?,"Law-abiding societies have long recognized the Code of Hammurabi for giving us the concept of a detailed written law. Hammurabi’s Code is harsh but fair: wrongdoers are punished in accordance with the harm done to their victims; few if any provisions are made for so-called “extenuating circumstances”. And although the 3,000-year-old Babylonian papyrus has been supplanted by more modern laws, sometimes we must look to Hammurabi for guidance on dealing with crimes not properly addressed by our modern legal doctrines.

I witnessed one such crime yesterday, while shopping for plumbing fixtures at Home Depot.

While browsing the reduced-price faucets, a man in a desperate condition wandered up to the toilet display — one of the grandest parts of any Home Depot, always arranged like a stately boulevard along the back wall of the store — and selected a premium 500-series American Standard bowl as his victim. He groaned something about the Arby’s next door before defiling the porcelain with unspeakable substances which I will not describe here. After completing his gastrointestinal expulsion, the man was ejected from the store peaceably with little more than a lifetime ban and allowed to carry on as if nothing had happened. However, I assure you, something *had* happened.

Remember that Hammurabi does not recognize “extenuating circumstances” in prescribing consequences for unlawful acts. Regardless of whether or not this man had been wronged by an unhygienic Arby’s franchise, he had absolutely no right to punish that innocent toilet, not to mention hordes of traumatized shoppers and the poor teenager in the orange apron who was forced to return the toilet display to a sanitary condition on his very first day on the job. 

With all that said, I have never taken the time to read and analyze the Code of Hammurabi in great detail, or consider how the Code’s dictums should be interpreted in a world so vastly different from that of ancient Mesopotamia. I also lack more than the most cursory grip on the complex Babylonian language. So although I look to Hammurabi for advice on how to justly handle the diarrhea vandalism incident, I would require the input of a true scholar to determine exactly how Hammurabi should be applied in this case. For example, where Hammurabi calls for those who taunt military horses to be “torn asunder and banished to the depths of the Euphrates”, what exactly does he envision? Can this clause be extended to those who “taunt” our modern workhorse, the faithful toilet, with their foul torrents of digestive waste? Does it apply in a retail setting? And can we substitute the Susquehanna River in place of the Euphrates?

3228,What if 10% of the adult population became bloodthirsty maniacs?,"What if 10% of the adult population in the world (around 550 million people evenly spread out) became bloodthirsty maniacs intent on killing normal people with little regard to their own life?

The 10% still retain their basic intelligence and all of their prior knowledge but have little to no impulse control when it comes to killing. They won’t hesitate to attack even if it means they won’t get as many victims as if they waited.",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x31a3bad90>,1601414429.0,"Those 10% would kill an inordinate amount of people and forever alter the world in ways that would be spoken of in the future like we speak about things like Noah's ark now, only this would be real. The average person is not prepared for some one in full rage mode but still harboring average intelligence to come at them with a gun, axe, bat, knife, etc out of no where with the intent to kill. It's not like it would be 90% on one side of the field and 10% on the other. 

It would be a mother giving her husband a hug from behind and slitting his throat, followed by her children. Then knocking on the neighbors door and going full murder mode when they opened it. It would be a hospital nurse injecting lethal doses of medication into patient after patient until caught, and then going after those that caught her with a scalpel. It would be any average citizen or law enforcement personnel with a gun turning up in a populated area and opening fire in every city, everywhere, but repeated over and over. Some would defend themselves, and it would be nearly impossible to tell them apart from the maniacs at first glance.

Society would, at least for a good while, collapse. The carnage on the first night would be ungodly. Even if every blood lusted person only managed to kill 2 people on average, that would be over 1 billion dead and an additional 550 million lost to the madness. 2 on average is, by my guess, wildly optimistic. 

Once word started getting out, no one would be leaving the house for anything. *Maybe* hospital staff would still be working in locked down hospitals, but even if some ambulances stayed running there would be nowhere near enough. Police would move only in squads and would be putting people down left and right. Any form of military body remaining would be distributed across major population centers and, if someone intelligent was in charge, would also secure farmlands, trucks, and diesel supplies. But for both law enforcement and military, that would take a good while as they'd have to weed out their own who turned and then get organized.

Fires would rage through neighborhoods, destroying houses, property, and lives. Fire departments would not be able to keep up, even if they bothered trying rather than protecting their families. 

I'd imagine that in some areas in America, those unaffected would band together and have armed squads keeping strangers out. It would take some time, but gradually the crazed would be put down. With the immediate danger over, the cold hard boot of logistics would fall on the necks of the living. Water would probably be ok as a critical resource that needed to be online immediately, and power would come back up as well in most places where the lines weren't damaged. Food is another matter though. 

Worldwide shipping would all but come to a halt. Covid crippled it for a good chunk of time there and that was no where near as fatal as this would be. Countries would begin to starve and refugees would attempt to flee to other countries for food. This would likely result in war and further death in many scenarios. Even if they had solid arable land, like the US, there would be difficulty in getting that food to everywhere it needed to be. Some people would hoard, other's would steal and hurt or kill others in doing so. The most vulnerable of the remaining population would likely starve. Medication and medical treatment would be severely diminished worldwide, and others would die from that. Gangs of various sorts would form in some areas, possibly for good reason at first, but doing the wrong thing for the right reason wouldn't mollify the wronged who would retaliate, generating more deaths and crimes of all sorts.

Then... there are the bodies. To put it in perspective, the US population is around 328,000,000. That would mean that 32,800,000 people would have gone insane. Let's say that, on average, they managed to kill 3 people each before they were put down themselves. Some would kill more, some would kill less, but 3 seems like a reasonable average. That's 40% of the US population, or 131,200,000 dead, but not buried. For the most part rotting wherever they lay. Rat and insect populations would increase as they had at no point in history. Who knows what diseases would manifest. Maybe we would get to name a brand new plague.

Sure, there would be cleanup attempts... but let's say that the average weight of those over 100 million was around 150 lbs, with children offsetting those over that number. That would be 19.68 **BILLION** pounds of corpses to move and dispose of. Can you imagine the sheer mass of that number? I can't. Although realistically, this would never actually happen in time for the weight to be that much. People would be too concerned with getting their next meal to handle this quickly, and rot would have accounted for a lot of body mass reduction with the added fun of every corpse being a bio hazard to move at that point.

In short, no one who survived this would recognize the world thereafter. At best guess around half of the US population might make it through this. Some countries, like Japan, would probably have more survive and might rebound faster. Many countries would be far, far worse off than the US. There would never be a getting back to normal. Long term, I'd think the focus would be on securing food and distribution lines. Local farming and gardening would be a *major* way of life change that almost everyone would take part in. The disposable culture we live in now might well turn more toward the hoarding end of the spectrum as a lot of goods would just not be produced anymore. Population masses might spread out from centralized city living to being more focused around food sources. 

Manufacturing would probably come back on shore in a big way, which would be great as a ton of jobs would probably cease to exist and, at least for a while, money might cease to mean anything as well. The way we were governed and the laws we live under, as well as their punishments, might change dramatically. It's not impossible for some countries who were ostensibly democratic to have someone seize power in the chaos. Give starving people food and put a little order back in their lives and they're unlikely to complain when you want to keep leading. 

On the up side though, assuming no one got access to nukes or were able to send nuclear power plants into meltdown, the planet would be much better off without so many of us.",572

We (my partner and I) were dispatched to a rollover in the middle of bum-fuck-nowhere on a late Friday night. The volly fire department out there had gotten on scene before us since we were a good 25-30 minutes out and advised a possible DOA over the radio. I remember the sudden spike of adrenaline coupled with crushing anxiety that, as a rookie EMT, I may or may not be able to handle seeing an actual body mangled beyond recognition. The anticipation for my own reaction alone was enough to turn my stomach.

Anyway, we get there and this car is turned over in the woods after it had clearly took out a MASSIVE pine tree.  Before seeing the body, the first thing I notice is brain matter splattered all inside the windows. The car alarm is still going off and the windshield is completely obliterated but tempered, allowing it to still be somewhat intact. Our guess is that the guy, who wasn't wearing his seatbelt, had hit his head so hard against the windshield upon impact, that it basically exploded. Once we were able to access the inside of the vehicle, we found his body contorted in the backseat. Couldn't see what was left of his head because of the way his torso had hyper-extended (think scorpion). Since my paramedic partner was adamant about obtaining a 4-lead EKG before confirming obvious death, I had to actually get hands-on with the body in order to put on the electrodes. When I picked up the leg, it literally flopped like a giant noodle. The gross factor was intensified by the sound it made... Rice Krispies was definitely not on next day's breakfast menu.

As far as my overall reaction, I was surprisingly fascinated by the condition of the body from an anatomical perspective, all while maintaining professional composure. Come to find out, I fucking love gross shit. I've also learned that the trick in dealing with disturbing calls is to ultimately flip on some sort of ""sociopath switch""-- basically dehumanizing the person by viewing the body alone as a complex meat machine as opposed to a person with an identity. There was a moment where I was challenged when some family photos had fallen out after busting into the rear driver's side window. However, I did what everyone I know in my profession has been taught to do to maintain sanity in those moments: ""Avert your eyes and don't even think about it."" 

Every now and then, I get the occasional flashback of picking brain matter out of my boots and in that moment briefly reflecting on how these slimey clumps once composed this person's thoughts, feelings, and memories... All in all though, I'd say I'm minimally affected by these sorts of calls as far as actual lingering symptoms of PTSD go. If anything, it's the coping mechanism that I, among other professionals in the field, have had to take on in order to do this kind of job which seems to do the most damage. Once you're conditioned to react to things that tug at your emotions through method of avoidance, it does eventually spill over into your personal life. 

For example, one of my biggest problems after 3 years in the service is that I can no longer grieve properly. I compartmentalize things that emotionally trouble me without even realizing it. The first time I noticed was after losing my grandpa to esophageal cancer when I was unable to allow myself to cry and fully process his death without automatically taking a mental detour to a drone-like state.

Sorry I blabbed on. It wasn't for nothing though; I found it to be rather cathartic. I hope this satisfies the answer(s) you were looking for.

EDIT: Added a couple lines to the second paragraph.

EDIT 2: For clarification, my moral compass and ability to feel is still very much intact. In fact, I still hold myself true to the textbook example of an empath... I just suck at letting myself cry.

&#x200B;

What the Russian security do if Putin's clearly dead and Biden's clearly alive is anyone's guess.

&#x200B;

After the fact, assuming Biden lives, the locals may not arrest him as heads of state typically enjoy immunity from prosecution.  He certainly wouldn't be taken to Russia in the immediate future.  He'd probably go back to America.

&#x200B;

From Russia's perspective it's an act of war by the United States against them.  The exact response depends on who Putin's successor is.

&#x200B;

From the US perspective there's no automatic removal, but unless it was pre-planned the Vice President (if there is one) almost certainly invokes the 25th amendment immediately and removes him from office temporarily, becoming Acting President.  He would then be impeached, convicted and removed permanently.

&#x200B;

If there is no VP then impeachment would be the only mechanism to remove him, but it would  be done very, very quickly.  If he were flying back from Estonia or Finland it would probably be done before his flight landed - who's going to argue? - with the Speaker stepping up as Acting President.

&#x200B;

Best case scenario, and probably most likely, is that the new President or Acting President performs a grovelling apology to Russia, Biden is either committed, imprisoned for life or executed.  They probably wouldn't extradite him, but if it's the only thing stopping a way, who knows.  There are massive reparations, and the US turns a blind eye to a lot of Russian aggression in future.

3268,"If you locked a morbidly obese person in a room with no food and a person at a healthy weight in another, would the obese person last longer before starving?","Also, would the obese person lose a significant amount of weight before dying? Would they lose more than the healthy person? This is all assuming neither of them resort to self-cannabalism before their deaths.",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x31c02d7d0>,1576536359.0,"The obese person would live longer because he has a large store of fat which he can metabolize for energy. However, he would still eventually die due to ketoacidoses. 
The brain typically relies upon glucose for fuel. The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen, but after about two days of fasting, it runs out. At that point, the brain begins to rely on ketone bodies for fuel, which are synthesized from fat. The problem is, ketone bodies are acidic, and the ph of your blood eventually gets so low that it kills you. This actually happens to people with diabetes a lot.

While this puts a cap on the amount of time you can survive without food, people who are skinny and do not have ample fat will last a shorter amount of time since they can’t prolong themselves with ketone bodies. A skinny person will probably die of heart or liver failure, since his body will resort to metabolizing amino acids for energy, which he will get from the proteins in his skeletal muscle and organs.

I should note that I’m not a doctor or anything, but I learned about this in a biochemistry class. I might have gotten a few details wrong.

Edit: apparently there have been instances of people fasting for super long times without entering ketoacidosis. It’s more like a potential problem rather than an inevitability.

 “Starvation usually produces a mild metabolic acidosis, but when combined with physiologic stress, starvation may cause a severe metabolic acidosis.” Toth HL, Greenbaum LA. Severe acidosis caused by starvation and stress. Am J Kidney Dis. 2003;42(5):E16–E19. doi:10.1016/j.ajkd.2003.07.012

The principle that the body shifts its metabolism to ketosis during starvation is correct, but I was wrong that it would lower the blood’s ph to a dangerous level without exception. Theoretically, an obese person could survive for a period of time proportional to his fat stores. 

What I said about the skinny person is accurate.",927

3270,Is consensual cannibalism ok?,"Have you heard of Armin Meiwes? He found someone who wanted to be eaten and then he ate them. Is that ethical? Not legal, but ethical.

I think so, my co-host does not. I have a podcast called That's So Fucked Up where my co-host and I just debated this. I should have come here first lol.

**Edit:** Some background: Armin Meiwes worked as a computer repair technician, and at the age of 40 Meiwes posted an advertisement on the website *The Cannibal Cric* (EDIT: actually called the Cannibal Cafe) which is a forum for people with a cannibalism fetish.

Looking for a willing volunteer, Meiwes's post stated that he was ""looking for a well-built 18- to 30-year-old to be slaughtered and then consumed.""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Meiwes#cite_note-news0-2) Bernd Jürgen Armando Brandes, an engineer from Berlin, answered the advertisement in March 2001.

The two made a videotape when they met on 9 March 2001 in Meiwes's home, in the small town of Wüstefeld showing Meiwes amputating Brandes's penis (with his agreement) and the two men attempting to eat it together. Before doing so, Brandes swallowed twenty sleeping pills, and a bottle of cough syrup. Brandes initially insisted that Meiwes attempt to bite his penis off. This did not work, and ultimately, Meiwes used a knife to remove Brandes's appendage. Brandes apparently tried to eat some of his own penis raw but could not, because it was too tough and, as he put it, ""chewy"". Meiwes then fried the penis in a pan with salt, pepper, wine, and garlic; he then fried it with some of Brandes's fat, but by then it was too burnt to be consumed. He then chopped the penis up into chunks and fed it to his dog.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armin_Meiwes#cite_note-BodyShock-1) According to court officials who saw the video (which has not been made public), Brandes may already have been too weakened from blood loss to eat any of his penis.

Meiwes then ran Brandes a bath, before going to read a *Star Trek* book, while checking back on Brandes every fifteen minutes, during which time Brandes lay bleeding in the bath. Brandes continued to drift in and out of consciousness before finally collapsing again. After long hesitation and prayer, Meiwes killed Brandes by stabbing him in the [throat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat), after which he hung the body on a [meat hook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_hook). The incident was recorded on a four-hour videotape. Meiwes dismembered and ate the corpse over the next ten months, storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes and consuming up to 20 kilograms (44 lb) of the flesh. According to prosecutors, Meiwes committed the act for sexual pleasure. ***He’s currently serving life imprisonment, for murder.***

Taking genetic modification to its conclusion, we could essentially design ourselves like a custom character, only with stronger, less volatile parts - and then just fit the CNS onto that.

What would be the hardest to get rid of? Heart? Lungs? Digestive system?",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x31c116ed0>,1607291566.0,"Very far. We've only just started to be able to create very primitive cybernetics. While the technology is advancing pretty quickly, full-on ""brain-in-a-jar""-type morphological freedom I'd say is probably at least a century out. The main obstacles we would need to overcome first are proving that the brain can survive outside the body for an extended period of time, or at least enough time that it can be placed into a new body and proving that all our sensory stimuli (sight, hearing, touch, etc.) can be swapped out for synthetic replacements with fidelities that meet or exceed that of baseline humans.

In terms of which organ system would be hardest to replace, It may not be the case that one is necessarily harder than the other. Artificial hearts, lungs, kidneys, etc. are all things that exist *today*. Considering that the quality of these devices will only get better, the difficulty may not lie in making the organs themselves, but in linking them together in a way that they can be controlled and affected the rest of the body. Organ systems are extremely complex and  closely interwoven things, interacting with each other in ways that could be considered a kind of intelligence. Our early cybernetic organ systems may not be able to account for these kinds of nuances. 

Early versions of this technology may rely heavily on biomechatronics and mostly mechanically-based organ systems requiring frequent maintenance and service (for example, endocrine sacs needing to refilled with the hormone they're supposed to secrete). More advanced versions may leverage genetic engineering tech to create more organic body designs, with a greater degree of self-sustainability (think organ printing, stem cell tech). Extremely advanced levels of this technology may combine genetic engineering with molecular nanotechnology (""bionano"" in Orion's arm-speak) to create extremely high-functioning and efficient bodies and organ systems that blur the line between organic and artifical.

The implications of this kind of technology are pretty clear - extremely high levels of morphological freedom, or in other words, the ability to look like basically whatever you want. Maybe you want the physique of an ancient Greek athlete with enhanced strength and speed, maybe you want to live an exact physical body replica of 1993 Danny Devito, maybe you want to live in the body of a giant, flying, rainbow-colored, quadrotor turtle. Your appearance may really be only limited by your imagination. 

Without structural and functional alterations to the brain, there may be some limits on *extremely* foreign body plans (eg, multiple parts of a body spread out in different locations, bodies with high amounts of extra limbs or high-bandwidth sensory inputs) however the brain is a highly plastic thing and I suspect most people will be able to adjust to a roughly anthropomorphic form with reasonable ease.

Additionally this technology may be limited by factors like cost and accessibility. While it may become commonplace in the future, the surgery that would facilitate this technology would still be profoundly invasive, complex and time-consuming. The first people to gain access to it are likely to be militaries (DARPA is already deeply immersed in BCI and cybernetics reasearch) looking to find ways to enhance their troops or to help them regain body functionality lost in combat. After that, it would likely trickle down to be applied to broader medical purposes, used in cases where the body has been catastrophically impaired (malignant cancers that have spread to multiple organs, accidents in which most of the body has been destroyed). Purely recreational use may come very late or not at all (people generally aren't willing to discard their entire body just to look different)

But again, this is all very far off. Fully functional neuroprosthetics with two-way neural communication likely won't be achieved for another decade or two, and total somatic replacement is light-years beyond that.",422

\-many serial killers are motivated by sexual reasons, so of course they murder the people that fit their attraction (which are mostly, though not always as shown above, of the opposite sex)

\-some serial killers murder for financial reasons, which means that they often choose victims whose trust they can gain easily or who do not have many relatives who could miss them, regardless of sex

Most drugs (and for the same reason, most poisons) have what's called a biological half life. This is essentially the time it takes for your body to eliminate half of a present substance. The poison or antidote will pretty much keep doing its thing for the duration of its effect. 

Lemme give you an example. One I see often is opiate overdose. As you may know, the ""antidote"" in this case is narcan. It acts by blocking the receptors in the body that absorb opiates. If you were to give someone narcan and then a bunch of fentanyl, chances are they'd have minimal effects from the opiate, as the narcan is still blocking your receptors. However, many opiates have longer biological half lives than that of narcan, which results in needing another hit of narcan once the first dose wears off to deal with the continuing metabolism of the opiate.

How exactly would one determine with certainty who a pedophile is, if they don’t act on it? Do pedos just step up and put their name on a list and say “Ok, when is my turn to die?”

Suppose someone comes up with a test that detects pedos? How are you going to feel when you’re tested and it somehow comes out positive, even if you’ve never had a pedo thought, or even been around children?

Who is going to pay for all the lawsuits from families who’s loved one was put to death, not because they sexually assaulted anyone, but because they tested positive?

This is macabre, but they know that some of the astronauts were alive when the compartment hit the water, because the oxygen had been turned on to some of the personal emergency tanks, and some switches had been flipped that could only be flipped by an actual person and not by accident. 

It was also a very different time, where you had to have an actual camera with film, and have the film developed. You wouldn’t be able to covertly take photos like you can these days.

3309,Why does your face change so much after death ?,"My cousin was put to rest, 3 weeks after her death yesterday. She passed from a car accident. But when I saw her yesterday at her funeral, nothing resembled her, her face was intact from the car accident, she actually died from 2 heart attacks following the accident. But yesterday at her viewing , her eye lids looked extremely sunken in, and I mean nothing at all looked like her self, I have never seen this before and I’ve seen dead relatives before her and they all looked somewhat alike, until yesterday",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x31cde3ed0>,1600406883.0,"Firstly, I’m so sorry for the loss of your cousin. To lose someone so suddenly and unexpectedly is incredibly difficult and I hope you have a strong support network with friends and/or family. 

To answer your question, I am a mortuary technician, and so will try to help you using my experiences. 

When someone passes away, after perhaps a week or so, the eyes will naturally sink in as the tissue breakdown processes begin. Sometimes, morticians and undertakers use tiny plastic caps under the eyelids to make the eyes looks rounder and fuller, but it sounds like these weren’t used for your cousin. 

Another thing is that when we reconstruct the deceased in death, we don’t know what they looked like in life because we didn’t know the person. This makes things difficult in terms of how to part their hair, did they smile like that, did the wrinkles in their face crease that way or differently, would their eyes shut like that or was there more definition in the cheeks? It’s all guesswork for us unless we have photos, and this means that these tiny features we may not get quite right mean that the face of the deceased is just not how they would have looked in life. It’s an unfortunate side to the job. 

When we die, all of our muscles relax and there is no tension within our faces, which can make people look very different to when they were alive, as we haven’t seen them in that way before. Again, as tissue breakdown occurs, this can exacerbate the lack of tension. 

Further, when we die, we go very pale as there is no blood circulation. There is also discolouration of the skin after a few days. 

Finally, the fact is that some people just look a lot different in death, and some people look like they could just be sleeping. Some people have mouths that just wont stay shut, or eyes that remain open no matter how much you try to close them. Death is a strange event and some people do look, and I know this sounds odd, a lot more ‘dead’ than other people do. I’m sorry that your cousin looked so different, but remember her as she was in life and not as you last saw her. Again, I’m sorry for your loss.",1205

A fight for happiness or at least some kind of mental stability. When I feel down I tend to isolate myself but that's not good. I know it's hard but try to open up to someone close to you. Tell a friend how you feel. Sometimes you might feel like a burden on others or like people don't care but you have to remember that that isn't the truth. There will always be people out there that care. And in some cases it might not be family and that's okay, because in the end of the day you choose your family, you choose the people you love. Everybody needs somebody to lean on and don't be afraid to admit it, don't be afraid to tell someone ""I need you right now"".

Like, after getting hit, it would make sense to bust a knee or something to eliminate the possibility of the attacker chasing and attacking you again.

3383,"Did my biological father actually die from “accidentally drinking too much and dying from having a fatal blood-alcohol level”, or is that virtually impossible? (More details inside if needed)","My parents divorced when I was 2 1/2 years old, and my mom started almost immediately dating my stepfather who she moved in with when I was five and married when I was six. He’s my father for all intents and purposes. My biological father was an alcoholic, and became a drug addict after the divorce. He usually didn’t show up to visitation, so I only saw him maybe ~15 times my whole life before he died of “accidentally overdrinking” when I was eight. 

As traumatic as the whole thing sounds, it’s surprisingly a non-factor for me emotionally. My stepfather was there right away and my biological father was very distant, so it’s not like I was dragged through his downward spiral while lacking fatherly influence. A few months ago I was with my grandparents (who saw my father as the black sheep of a very rich family, but treats me and my three half-siblings from dad’s previous marriage really well), and asked “wait, who’s that next to Uncle X and Uncle Y?” when looking at a picture of him with his two brothers, and my half-brother said “Uhhh, that’s dad” and we all laughed. That’s how little I think about him.

Now I’m 21 and drinking a lot (which in light of my genetics is a brilliant idea which surely won’t have any consequences), and my father’s alleged cause of death doesn’t make any sense. although I’ve never asked again because I didn’t really care about him much. When you drink too much and hit like 0.15 blood-alcohol level you start throwing up, and when you go over 0.3 you pass out. I find it rather hard to believe that my father just went for a night out at the bar and downed like 10 Johnnie Walker 60 oz’s (I did mention how rich his parents are, right?) and hit like 0.6 and died, completely oblivious to how much he was drinking and not having his life saved by the two aforementioned side effects of extreme drinking.",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x31f78ff10>,1570711682.0,"The absorption of alcohol is constant, so it *is* possible to down a ton of alcohol and have it creep up on you.  People have tried to commit murder by making it look like the person has drunk themselves to death and it’s incredibly suspicious looking as it’s not easy to do.

That being said, most people die by passing out, vomiting, and then aspirating the vomit. This is technically suffocation with the consumption of alcohol being a factor. This is why you should put a person who has passed out on their side and tilted slightly face down. There is a name for this position which currently isn’t coming to mind.

3385,What should parents do if they accidentally took part in human trafficking while trying to adopt?,"TLDR; what if you're a parent when you're trying to adopt but you accidentally took part in human trafficking?

My fiance and I have discussed about adopting the kid later in life and we were talking about taking parenting classes and what not, and I just remembered this question.

Remember I found the documentary about a family who adopted a little autistic 3-year-old boy from China and they were able to adopt him less than a year. Documentary was about how they clearly use this child to get views for their blogger family but then someone went deeper down the rabbit hole and talked about how stolden children from other countries is usually way easier but also super shady because usually it's done for human trafficking. I've also read stories about white couples who ""adopt"" Mexican children from Trump camps and they'll change the kid's name, and we're talking about what if we adopt a kid outside of our race (we're both White) and it turns out that kid was part of human trafficking. what would be the best to do for the child. I though like the kids didn't get adopted horrible person but it's also like oh dear God we just took part in human trafficking but the kid is safe but we just took humantrafficking.
Im just curious what will we do if we adopted a child who was actually stolen or taken or had anything to do with human trafficking what's the most moral thing we can do?

Edit 1: Like my biggest fear when it comes to adopting a child is finding out they were taken from a good family in an unlawfully matter

Edit 2: we were never really planning on doing it international adoption. But again we don't want to accidentally adopt child who was stolen

Edit 3: from edit 1 it doesn't matter if they were from a good or bad home, sometimes it's better for the child to be removed from a terrible home but not taken into human traffic is the point that was my bad for the misunderstanding sorry

Edit, context.  I spent some time in a state psych hospital myself for MDD and  addiction issues about 5 years ago.  There were a lot of long term  patients with schizophrenia and other progressive conditions.  They just seemed hopeless and miserable.  The only thing the doctors could seem to do was put them on a combo of meds that left them nearly catatonic.  One broke a window and jumped to death from  the 8th floor while I was there.

I'm still trying to recover and we haven't exhausted every option out there and there are options unavailable like weed or some new development but asking someone with severe depression to hold out on phantom hope seems a little unduly cruel. 

I'm still doing it. I'm not suicidally depressed but I am miserable in many ways. Cruelty is the only word that accurately describes my situation and many other people with mental illness. 

For me. I am I guess a subscriber to stoicism, if things ever get overwhelmingly unbearable and the few positives fizzle out then the only common sense solution is death really isn't it? Permanent solution sure but it is a solution. Funny enough knowing that if shit really hits the fan I can self-bail gives me more resilience I think. It's not that bad yet which is a good thing. Plus feeling like you have some control in a life that is plagued is also very helpful. It could be worse and I have some degree of control over how awful things are which makes things less awful.

Now the surviving maggots are swimming happily in a container of decaying human goop, that's consist of skins, dirts, hair, and dandruff.  The dandruff are scraped from my head after I took a bath, so it's a little wet and overtime it's cause the other matters to decay as well.

3420,Is it normal to have super intrusive thoughts so often?,"I’ll admit, I’ve gone through some really bad crap in my life and I deal with a few mental illnesses due to it, but is it normal to have super vivid and disturbing daydreams multiple times every day?

Things from rape, death, self harm/mutilation, etc. I imagine situations where I’m saved sometimes, but other times it’s just gruesome or plain horrifying. It can be someone getting crushed alive and I’ll replay it slowly over and over or I’m kidnapped and they’re torturing me until I die and then I’ll start it all over and change it in someway. Every time I come out of the daydreams I think “Wtf is wrong with me?!” And I hate that I have them. 

I don’t want to get into specifics, but just imagine some of the most screwed up things you can think of and it’s like I’ll doze off into la la land and that’s what goes through my head. It’s always super detail oriented too.

I feel so f’d up for it. It sucks so bad and I want to change it and stop it, I’ve tried and am still trying, not sure what to do.

(Also could be an incredible halloween decoration) he isn't quite sold on my idea, and my mother of course is fully opposed to it, which honestly is fair. My father isnt anywhere close to death yet but it's never too early to talk to your loved ones about your end of life plans. although it's a difficult topic, death is something that happens to everyone, and although it can be scary to think about, we all want our final moments with our loved ones to be comfortable and  special. Funerals are a difficult event and not to raise anxiety but, yours and your loved ones day will come. My father is an incredible man and I need him to depart and be remembered in a truly amazing and deserving way. So input about any of the above would be very much appreciated.

3428,How common is it for young children to abuse and terrify their parents (mother in particular?),"I’ve been on a psychological thriller kick, and there seems to be an uptick in books where a young child, usually a girl, abuses and scares her mother. 

Baby Teeth was one. If you’ve never read it, I highly suggest you do. Some of those scenes will haunt me forever. Scariest five year old ever. 

Little Liar by Clare Boyd is what I am reading now and it has the same plot. A pregnant mother is terrified of her 9 year old girl because she is physically abusive, manipulative of CPS and neighbors, and kind of a little psycho. 

So it got me wondering: how common an occurrence is it really? I tried to look it up, but the only accounts and stats I could find was for teenagers.

**Edit: Since this post has become about books, I thought I would recommend a few in the same vein. Some aren’t about fucked up kids, but there are a lot of fucked-up thrillers this group might like.**

**Fucked-up books about kids:**

The Silent Child by Sarah Denzil— a woman loses her six year old to a flood, and thinks he is dead. However he returns ten years later, mute. 

Before She Was Found by Heather Gudenkauf— this one is about middle school aged girls, most of whom are fucked up and abusive. So far, it is in my top five for the year. 

She Rides Shotgun by Jordan Harper— when her mother is murdered, a 9 year old girl joins her estranged father in exacting revenge. She embraces violence and becomes pretty monstrous.

The Perfect Child by Lucinda Berry— have not yet read, but seems to be in the same vein as Baby Teeth. 

The Fifth Child by Doris Lessig— have not yet read, but recommended in this thread. 



**Fucked-up books NOT about kids:**

My Lovely Wife by Samantha Downing isn’t about a fucked up child, but I recommended it in this thread. It is the closest approximation to the book You by Caroline Kepnes I have yet read. 

Before She Knew Him by Peter Swanson— an artist who realizes her neighbor is a killer. Reminded me a lot of Disturbia with Shia Lebeouf.

Behind Closed Doors by B.A Paris— a perfect relationship? Far from it. This book made me extremely anxious throughout, but the ending was pretty abrupt.

A dying body is not usually calm, is not swallowing normally (or at all), and may be producing more saliva and other body fluids due to stress.

A dying person’s breathing may be fast or irregular as well. If you let your saliva pool for a couple minutes, then hold your mouth open and breath in and out rapidly, notice what happens to your saliva. Let it slide back in your throat a little, and it will bubble up as air passes through it. Hence foam.

The tongue would start to protrude from the mouth. Normally, the abdomen would become rotund and full of gas, but this would not occur due to the 'flaying'. There would be fly eggs and maggots in the abdomen. The body will start to turn green and marbled. If animals would have turned up, they'd have gone for the easy pickings: the abdominal organs.

Phantom limb is caused by loss of nerves when a limb is removed and can be perceived in a number of ways but the most common is that they feel like their hands or feet are permanently clenched tightly which results in chronic pain from being unable to ""un-clench"" their limb.

In the case of a M to F sex change, the penis isn't cut off, it's reconfigured. The nerves are still there and sensation is still real. A penis is basically just an enlarged clitoris and the surgery involves turning the penis inside out and creating a vaginal canal with it.

3462,Would it be worse to drown in Honey or Peanut butter?,"I've done my research but a friend is against my conclusion, here are my points:

**-Density:** Peanut butter has a density of 1.08 kg/L (8% more dense than water) and honey has a density of anywhere from 1.38 to 1.45 kg/L (38-45% more dense than water) \[data comes from 10 mins of googling\] so that means you'd have a harder time floating in peanut butter than in honey.

**-Thickness:** Peanut butter is 25 times more viscous than honey at room temperature (I'm taking the jar of Skippy and the bottle of generic brand honey in my pantry as reference) so that means that you'd have a harder time moving around in peanut butter if you tried to reach the edge of the container you end up in and thus you'd get exhausted sooner, another point for peanut butter.

**-Allergies:** Useless statistic here but also googled it, apparently 1 in 200 adults (.5%) are allergic to peanuts and only .001% of people are estimated to be allergic to honey \[again, data comes from google\], so that's another point for PB but only in very specific situations.

These are the reasons I think it would be easier to die in PB, but my final argument as to why PB would be worse is:

**-How it would feel:** My friend's argument was ""Honey is sticky and dries out"" but in my opinion that would make no difference here. In a large vat of any of these substances it would take an enormous ammount of time for enough honey to cristalize on the surface of the container to trap the person, and the stickyness wouldn't have any effect unless they actually got out of the container, as inside the honey there's nothing else to stick to. Plus if it got into their mouth or nose, as it's not as thick, they could easily remove it

On the other side, peanut butter may not be sticky per se, but it wouldn't drip go away from your body like honey, it would stay in a thick layer around you, plus if it goes into your mouth or nose, it would be way harder to take it out of there.

&#x200B;

That's my info, what do you think?",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x322948e50>,1557176428.0,"Ive gotta say honey would be worse. 

Now peanut butter while sticky to an extent, is also pretty thick and at room temperature it doesn't flow like a liquid. I would assume submerging an adult human in peanut butter, ignoring allergies, would act like a thick quicksand. It'll suffocate you but you arent really ""drowning"" per say. The amount of peanut butter is just compressing your chest as you sink, eventually using up all of your available oxygen and sealing you in. 

Honey on the other hand is a thick flowing liquid. If you were to submerge a human in it, honey is going to fill in their orifices similar to water and fill the lungs. I assume the stickyness of the honey would make the air sacks in the lungs stick together when decompressed in the act of breathing. So your lungs are working twice as hard to get air in while filling with honey. Assuming this is correct, I imagine it would cause your lungs and airway to burn faster and possibly worse then if it were just water.

 This may act as a quicker death, but I think it would hurt to die by honey more then it would by peanut butter.",528

You’re describing what is referred to as a crush injury.  It would all depend on the seriousness of the injury and most importantly which part of the body is crushed.

However without any visible bleeding, your best bet for survival is having your lower extremities crushed (think of your legs crushed between two cars).  Internal bleeding is not a first line concern of ours. You risk dying when the object is moved (uncrushing) from the build up of lactic acid that occurs when while the circulation was stopped which will kill you quicker than it would take for the rest of your blood to leak out.

In some animal studies with rodents, tiny amounts of dilute formalin are injected into the paws for studies of acute and chronic pain. The effect is immediately noticeable even from such a small amount. So yes it would be a horrible agonizing death. 

There is a chance if you were quickly dunked and then immediately escaped and were able to rinse off somehow you would get away with severe chemical burns and possibly blindness.

I feel like it's a hidden secret that guys do have their eyes caught by teenage girls, especially since my generation dresses very liberally with booty shorts and tiny tops and all that.

Limbs rotting off from MRSA, massive trauma, faces burned off, among other things.  And a lot of time spent comforting people and hearing stories from war, childhoods, and a dying, dementia riddled Dad, who's son turned a shotgun on himself in front of him.

I struggle with trauma from things that happened to me, and relive them a lot.  But this isn't something I often think of as harmful to me.

It really doesn't phase me IRL.  The thought of seeing an adult turned into gore doesn't upset me.  Maybe a child would be different.  I like helping people.  I like making people feel better.  But it isn't a stressful thought.  I don't think shooting someone in self defense would effect me much either.

3537,How did my uncle die (help)?,"My mother won’t tell me how my uncle died. She’ll be able to tell me what happened in a few years, I think—it’s been years since his death already, but it’s still too soon.

I’m hoping that someone with more life experience than me can put the pieces together. Here is what I do know: 

- He died in his apartment, where he lived alone. I don’t know if he called someone first or was found after death, just that that’s the location he died.

- He was an alcoholic and tried to get sober a few times. I saw him during a sober stint once—he was yellowed, shaking, the works.

- He was a hoarder. It took days to “clean his apartment” after he died. I don’t now if that cleaning time was only spent on the hoarding, or if other measures needed attending to. I do know that my mom spent much time digging/sorting through his hoarded items , but I don’t know if that’s all that had to be done in vacating his apartment. 

- My mom confided in me that she always wonders if “they” could have done more for him. After this statement she quickly changed subjects, choking up, saying, “I don’t even want to think about that.” She had to calm herself down. 

- He did not have friends. He would talk to family over the phone every few days. 

- He died in his 40s.

Eventually the youth geoup leader took it too far with one of them, and he freaked out and told his parents, who in turn freaked out and wanted to call the police. The pastor asked them not to, that he would deal with it. They (the pastor and his cronies) confronted the pedo, who, like the slimy worm of a prick he was, decided to break down in tears and repent, minimizing his crime and begging for forgiveness, and the leadership all laid hands on him and prayed for him. This was not enough for the parents, who involved the police and basically assisted in a sting operation to get the pedo busted. In response to the drama it caused, the church had a meeting, during which one leader (pastor's son) got up and talked (literally cried) about how he heard some of the young men in the church were taking part in very sinful things (addressing the CHILDREN WHO WERE MOLESTED, not the pedophile), shaming them for their acts and encouraging them to come forward for prayer. Then the head pastor talked about how shameful it was for the family to call the cops and not trust god to bring justice inside of the church (they didnt want to make the news). The pedo went to jail despite the church's best efforts, and the victims (especially those that remain in the church) are forever tormented about what happened, feeling condemned for taking part in such horrid, ungodly acts.

On the other hand, rabies is a virus. It's not alive, and its ""goal"" is simply to reproduce while it drains the resources of whatever it's infecting. It doesn't care what the thing it's infecting does. 

If the two were somehow infecting the same animal, one would dominate the other, most likely the rabies virus since what it does it actively at odds with cordyceps. Can't get nutrients when your brain won't even let you drink water.

Assuming the rabies virus laid dormant, then worst case scenario cordyceps would just poison a person in a similar way to other poisonous mushrooms, and best case scenario it's the kind of cordyceps that's safe to consume so the bite poses no real risk (beyond now having the rabies virus in the person).",7

After prolonged starvation, a couple things happen to your body. One of them is you lose energy, I mean all that you have. Your entire body hurts when you move (especially muscle areas that are used to moving like arms and legs) because it's ""burning itself"" in order to get every small bit of energy.  
Your head will also hurt. Our brain is a machine working no stop 24/7, you can't avoid thinking and that requires energy. After you don't get enough energy you can barely move and think until you're almost numb to everything when you are conscious.  
You didn't mention anything about liquids but if you stop drinking too this will happen much sooner (and you'll die much sooner as well).

One tree takes up two 25ft from one another so. 25X167 you need 4175ft just to kill one person with apple seeds. Which would mean you need near 7-9k for the near 1 hectare of land and to plant a tree would cost you around £100/$110 so 100 times 167 is 167,000 along with the 9000 would be a grand total of around 155,000 to kill one person with apple seeds",19

cement is caustic, so it would burn tissue it came into contact with over a short period of time. Mouth, throat, stomach - all would suffer from severe chemical burns.

if, somehow, you survived the initial ingestion, and you tolerated the chemical burns, and you were able to still breathe - you you would then receive signifigant internal burns from the heat of the cement as the exothermic reaction began during curing. presuming the reaction with your body fluids did not result in more carnage internally.

In order to prevent a possible global famine or environmental problems (global warming, environmental pollution, etc.), which are already a big problem, keeping the world population under control is a very convenient method, and to tell the truth, a DEFINITELY NECESSARY method.  The natural resources of the world will run out very soon and this gigantic order, where everything is made of oil, will be in an insurmountable stalemate. At the very least, I think governments are keeping the world's population in check to slow this from happening.  World wars, epidemics, and nuclear war are all terrifying things, but accept it or not, they're all necessary. I cannot calculate how many billions the world's population would have been if there had been no world wars or no epidemics, because I am not a mathematician, but with a simple reasoning: 

the worldwide fertility rate is 2 according to research. Let's say a 17-year-old boy marries a woman when he turns 25 and has 2 children. When these two children grew up, they married others and they had 2 children, and their children grew up, they married others and they had 2 chi… what if this child had been killed when he was 17?

I know it's unethical, but in today's world they don't do it that way anyway.  Have you ever thought? Why is the social welfare of states with a large population so low? because they want it that way. Can't countries like China or India reduce the crime rate in society by setting strict rules? Of course they can, both countries are in the top 5 largest economies in the world, but they are not doing it because they want the population to decrease silently. Remember, if you were born in North Korea, your knowledge of the world would only be as described to you. We are lucky not to have been born in North Korea, but what we know about the world is what governments reflect in the media.

>Why is the social welfare of states with a large population so low?

There is no causal relationship between the size of social welfare systems and the size of the population. The only meaningful causal relationship is that between the population pyramid of the country and the size of the social welfare system. Older population = smaller working population = less money = less social welfare.

>The natural resources of the world will run out very soon and this gigantic order, where everything is made of oil, will be in an insurmountable stalemate.

This is also not really true. In the 70's, the idea of 'peak oil' was very popular. And, whilst, technically true, the original estimates left out a lot of variables. According to the original estimates, we would have already reached peak oil a decade ago. But that hasn't happened. This is because technological innovations have led to more ways to find more oil. This means that peak oil is always 10 years away -- and it keeps getting further away. It's very possible that we won't reach it in a hundred years. By that time, we'll have already transitioned.

>In order to prevent a possible global famine or environmental problems (global warming, environmental pollution, etc.),

This argument is faulty because it assumes that human beings produce co2 *per se*. This is not the case. Humans do not inherently produce excess co2. We are totally able to produce less. It's just that our current economic system (capitalism) encourages infinite economic grown and consumption. This is unsustainable, but not a factor inherently attributable to humans as a species. Unless you believe that humans are inherently capitalistic.

Lastly, I want to hit on something very important. What you're currently describing is an acute problem that currently very much exists in Europe. The European population is not reproducing at a sustainable rate. As a consequence, the *governments of Europe* are implementing measures to prevent this demographic collapse. This is entirely contrary to your theory.

Moreover, looking at China, Japan and the US, these countries are also actively taking measures to *encourage* births.

Also, let me lastly make the following argument: if you truly believe that the world wars were staged in a global conspiracy, then you must assume that there is some global elite that has for centuries secretly controlled the world. There is no evidence for this. In fact, to the contrary, there is a lot of evidence against it. The world is absolutely filled with nationalistic behaviour that would be extremely contrary to some supposed secret world government. Although there are a lot of conspiracy theorists who love this idea, most of them are baselessly use the idea to justify antisemitism -- in particular Adolf Hitler.

In general, I have to say that I believe that your theory relies on an ingorance on very basic historical and political observations. I think that if you studied the policies of governments more, you would discover the opposite of your theory is true.",51

After a while, you just become numb to all of it. I rarely, if ever, have done shrooms two days in a row. When I'm on a shroom trip, my dopamine is off the charts. But the tradeoff is that I feel pretty low over the next few days.  


Same with weed. Yeah, you certainly can (and I have) spend the whole day stoned. But it just doesn't do much past a certain point. The first hit of the day and a few after that will get you there. Any subsequent hits will just make you numb. 

  
I also lose appetite on shrooms and gain appetite on weed (These should make a video game of this + 5 appetite after THC consumption), so I guess eating and drinking would depend on what you're consuming.   


Eventually you'll either feel numb, or like shit, becuase the lack of proper food or water will have your stomach churning acid and fucking you up.

For those of you who have seen/played The Last of Us, would you be able to do what Joel did for Ellie in the final episode? Skip the following paragraph if you are familiar with the plot.  
If you don’t know, basically, there’s a zombie apocalypse and there's this man named Joel and this little girl named Ellie. Their relationship is complicated, but the gist is that they're like father and daughter and deeply love and care about one another. Ellie has an immunity to the fungus that is turning everyone into zombies, which makes her very interesting to medical professionals trying to cure the fungus and stop the pandemic. Joel is essentially tricked into bringing Ellie to a hospital for her brain to be harvested and possibly cure the fungus, potentially saving millions of lives and saving the world. His intense love for his daughter takes over him, and he massacres the entire hospital, hundreds, maybe thousands, idk, of innocent lives and sabotages any possibility of a cure for the fungus that has destroyed their planet in order to save her. When they're safe in the aftermath, he never tells her he did this. I always thought this was an emotionally charged and illogical course of action, but the more that I think about it, I really don't know what I'd do.

I asked my own dad, who is a doctor, if he'd do that to save me. I expected him to tell me how dearly he loves me and how he'd do anything for me, but he could not end hundreds of lives to save me, especially given the possibility that my own sacrifice could literally save the WORLD. At least, that was my way of thinking before he answered. Instead, without any hesitation, he said absolutely. He also said he probably would not tell me afterwards, just as Joel did. My dad is a very nonviolent and rational guy, so it made me reconsider my stance. For the parents, is love for one's child really so strong that it would cause one to make such a destructive decision without second thoughts? What would you do in Joel's place?

On a related note, would you be able to kill a loved one who had transformed into a zombie if it meant saving other lives including yours?

The head would definitely explode. It doesn't matter which angle they hit the ground. Once the head hits, it will blow up. Every bone in the body will break in some way. 

At first you may see some twitching and misinterpret it as the person still being alive, but this is a very normal occurrence in deaths where severe head trauma occurs. They may even make some absurd vocal gurgling noises coming directly from their exposed throat. 

As their body lay there, you will watch it quickly flatten out as the support from their skeleton is gone, their muscles are flattened and torn as well. They will look very pancakey. Their limbs will be twisted in insane ways. Something that frequently occurs is the roundish bones in the body explode, as the head does, subsequently detaching whatever was connected to them. So you may get to see some full on dismemberment. Or at the very least, detachment while the skin does its best to keep hold of the arms below the elbow, and legs below the knee. Shoes will definitely fly off, 100%. Their feet will look completely ridiculous as the heals are shattered and gone, the legs bent & twisted. Everything about them will be bent, twisted, and flat... except for the head. The head will be pretty much gone 🤣 

I've seen videos where pants fly off as well! Lots of crazy stuff happens when someone hits something at high velocity. It takes around 12 seconds for a human to reach terminal velocity, about 1,500 feet. If terminal velocity is reached and they hit concrete, the damage would be very similar to a bomb exploding inside someone's torso. They will be completely exploded! Everything smashes, blows up, and bounces in different directions! 😁",17

Some pass out from shock and some don’t.

If you land on your head hard then it’s likely you will be blacked out and have heavy memory loss for about 1/2 days or longer if you are in a comatose state, again it all depends on the severity of the damage and height and how you land so it’s a mixed bag from person to person.

Usually this process is pretty painful and it draws a bit of blood, but the pain feels good and I look forward to it.

Our teeth are also pretty lame as far as omnivore teeth go. They look more like herbivore teeth, like a horse. Our teeth don’t look like bears or dogs, which are actually omnivores and they definitely don’t look like carnivore teeth, like cats and ferrets. Humans teeth aren’t puncturing anywhere deep enough to hang on, much less tear a finger off with our laughable bite force.

I have always wondered since then, how rapists “choose” - is there someone they see some day and decide on it, or ….?

What do rapist anticipate will happen to them, or their relationship with the victim, once they’ve committed a rape? Do they understand it’s a crime and they will go to jail (in a just world) and their victim will forever hate and fear them? Or do they think it’s just a normal Tuesday and everyone will just move on? 

Bonus question:  I was raped by a boyfriend on my 23rd birthday. He said it was a misunderstanding. I believe my drink was spiked at a bar because I only had 2-3 drinks but something was very wrong. I didn’t know where I was, who he was, and continuously fought and screamed for me to get off of me. He said I was just confused and he was “irritated” by my “ behavior”.

so around 1865-1877 was the period of reconstruction, which meant african americans were regaining their civil rights back, but that only meant more discrimination and violence against them because whites were afraid of competition from recently freed black slaves, whose freedom made a huge tilt to the agricultural economy.

news outlets at the time, im pretty sure they made every crime a black person were to commit a big deal and sensationalize it to generate public outcry.

tldr; most if not all lynching victims during this period were black people and the white guys didnt quite like that they were free

3785,"Is it ethical to tell terminally ill children that if/when they die, they will go to Heaven?","Was watching some medical footage, and came across a family with a terminally ill 4-year-old whose condition would likely not respond to further treatment. They gave her a choice: the next time she gets sick, she can either go to the hospital to try to get treatment, or she can “stay at home and go to Heaven.” They explained that in Heaven, she wouldn’t have to use her wheelchair, and she would feel completely healthy. They said that they would meet her in Heaven later. She ended up deciding to “stay home to go to Heaven.” Her choice was informed by an understanding that Heaven was something that would *absolutely exist*, and that *she would no longer be ill when she went there.*

I’m interested in how this relates to informed consent. Young children cannot yet fully understand life, death, and the possibility of an afterlife. An older patient given the same choice may choose differently due to an increased understanding of the world and developing their own beliefs surrounding death and the afterlife.

Vomit I am sure has to taste different. Like I have experience vomiting both on alcohol and sober, but when I vomit I focus more on the physical sensation and not on the details of the taste. All I know it’s pretty sour in both cases, because of stomach acid and all. But freshly consumed alcohol has to add flavor, right?",4

I do not want to be taken as some random thing in the street people can just toy with for pleasure especially from some pathetic drug addict high schoolers.

I made full eye contact trying to stare them down and communicate that nothing about them gave me reason to feel fear and if they tried to really get up in my space I'd be ready to get violent for my physical space being violated (and I do carry a knife that I'd be ready to use in response to that situation). I stared at them directly till they were far off, they noticed this. Now I see these freaks out and about occasionally and I'm just wondering how people like this might take someone who stared them down. Am I asking for potential more serious trouble down the line because I won't bend over and be intimidated or react angrily like they want, or do they understand they won't get a reaction they want like lashing back unless they actually get my face and try to threaten me, giving opportunity for self defense and use the law against them so they won't bother and would rather go find some other target to harass?

While I am no expert my assumption is that if you are trying to kill someone with poison you don't put in just enough, you put in as much as you can without it becoming noticeable.

I would also guess that one does not here about successful assassination via poison all that often because it is probably a rather unreliable way.

Edit: Noticed I misread the question. Since the amount of alcohol is the same it will have pretty much the same effect. The higher concentration leads to a faster onset of the effect initially though. Since the transfer of substances in the body is not really a guided process like someone who is sorting stuff on a conveyor but more like a bunch of packages floating around till they randomly arrive at a shelf that accepts them the larger number of alcohol packages leads to the likelihood of a package getting to an alcohol shelf being higher. 

The more packages that are accepted the lower the likelihood becomes and the process slows down. That is the Reason people always say to not drink on an empty stomache, if you have eaten before the alcohol goes into the blood slower and you don't get drunk as fast.",2
3832,"Why is it so wrong to want end your life quickly and painlessly after being diagnosed with a progressive, degenerative illness (i.e. Alzheimer's, ALS, etc), as opposed to subjecting your loved ones to watching you slowly deteriorate, knowing that there's nothing they can do for you?","With Alzheimer's, you eventually reach the point where you can't recognize your family, or get confused as to where you are even if you're at home (at least most of the time; my grandfather was officially diagnosed with Alzheimer's but he never got to the point where he wasn't able to recognize his family, nor forget the layout of his house, and of course he remembered a lot about his younger years, and I regret not taking the time to ask more questions about things such as what his mother was like, etc.). And they have to watch you slowly deteriorate into a person whom they can't recognize because it's so difficult for them to see you in such a bad condition, because so different from how you used to be.

So why can't you, while you're either are in the early stages where you're doing things like forgetting where you put stuff stuff, or getting lost while you're out and about, or have it stipulated in your end-of-life wishes that you would like the opportunity to say a proper goodbye to your loved-ones before you die, then end your life quickly and painlessly?

""Cane, it isn't like that. That special feeling that Arnica told me about..."" She pulls something from behind her back. Cane cranes his neck to the side in order to see what it was, but his question would be answered soon enough.

""It's lovely isn't it? That I finally found ou-"" *Bang!*

The sound washed the field in noise like the sound of Zeus's ire. Fireflies welled up from a small tunnel sitting away from eyeshot and a medium sized hole appeared in her temple, with the secondary 'cough' of the firearm soaring out of hearing distance off into the nighttime air. A wedding band rolled past Cane's sitting form.

It wasn't like in the movies. No stumbling, going silent before finally moving to the ground, or letting out one last word before falling asleep. She didn't look like she was sleeping. She just looked dead. Instant loss of muscle function with a short exhale, not one unlike the ending of a healthy yawn. No twitching, either.

As someone who's heard that sound before, Cane knew exactly what it was. The words of his old friend, a weapons geek, emerged from the black sea of shock that was taking the place of higher thinking at that moment.

""A subcompact version of the AKM platform, chambered in the same iconic 7.62x39 millimeter that you're so familiar with and made of blood-infused steel! You can shoot as many Aergon Venom rounds as you want! Small enough to be concealed on one person, too! What about this doesn't satisfy you?""

A familiar cadence broke the deathly silence.

""It didn't *have* to be like this, Cane. I didn't *want* it to be like this. But this is what it took to show you what you've done wrong. The thing about saving people is that it doesn't matter how you feel. Emotions come and go, go... And come back. Don't let lives depend on--"" A sob broke through his speech after he failed to throttle it. ""I can't do this anymore. You took away my brother, my dad, and now..."" The owner of the voice sighed, a motor and two rusted accordions creaking inside of his chassis with two yellow-sclera-having orbs facing your organic ones. He didn't even look human now, compared to the last time Cane seen him.

A single tear fell and the pencil that wrote the ninth symphony was dropped and shattered. The climax was thick in the air.

""Under This hallowed moon I call upon the holy guidance of Deya'Loah's flaming Excalibur; its irascibility. Only one of us..."" He choked a single time. ""Will see the end of this night. I, Adamn Dreksehn, Son of Ketsækhe Loah and... The crime of defilement... ask you, Cane Castor, for a duel in front of our god.""

&#x200B;

I think I added too much.

Context: Cane, the main character, ran away from his school made to create elite soldiers because he didn't like it. A kid called Adamn who Cane saw falling behind and decided to help train after his own schooling took over his spot as the new ""high-promise student,"" and for Adamn's trial to graduate, he needed to hunt Cane down and bring him back, dead or alive. He killed that girl to further hammer in the ""that's what you get"" message.

Aergons are genetically modified humans. The full explanation would take hours. To sum it up, though, Aergon Venom is one of the ways to get around their regeneration. It's a mix of an acid and a powerful psychedelic, which can corrode barrels with careless use.

Deya'Loah is the god of a certain religion in the story. Dueling is still a thing thanks to the text related to this faith. It translates roughly to ""Glass Deity.""",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x32883f6d0>,1692935440.0,kinda cringe,2

Being said there isn't that much put into studying human consumption of raw human meat, and we do not have the best records of historic anthropophagy in relation to impacts of raw human meat either. With better documented cases there's also other things that may provide an impact, for instance the plane crash in the Andes had frozen bodies- that's going to be different than bodies stored in non freezing conditions.

#Desktop

## Users using Old Reddit can do so with RES

If you don't have Reddit Enhancement Suite [Click here to get it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/wiki/config/sidebar)

1. Open your [RES Console](https://i.imgur.com/AkRYUod.png)

2. Open Subreddits, then FilteReddit. [Scroll down until you find Filter by Flair](https://i.imgur.com/uMOLocx.png)

3. Add the flairs you don't want to see anymore.

## Redesign Users 

Desktop users using the redesign can [Click on flair to filter from the sidebar](https://i.imgur.com/lQBOJCg.png). Note that this will only show that specific flair. If you want to view the front page with one or more flairs missing, follow the guide in the next section.

##Mobile Web & Desktop users can filter using the search function. 

Type `-flair:FLAIRNAME` in the search box. This also works on the re-design for desktop.

Or bookmark this link, amended to whichever your preference is, currently set to sex/NSFW questions: https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/search?q=-flair%3Asex%2FNSFW&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=day

You can add more filters by writing `-flair:FLAIRHERE, -flair:FLAIRHERE` etc. This also works on the re-design for desktop, however you'll have to manually sort by ""top"" and ""last 24 hours"" every time you add a new flair to the list.

This will show you the front page as it exists **without** the posts that have the flairs you specify.

#Mobile

##Reddit (Official) 

1. Search in the search bar at the top of the app the subreddit you want to view, then select it.

2. After you've landed on that sub, tap the search bar again. When you do a list of [popular flairs will appear](https://i.imgur.com/uRqvdnP.png)

3. Tapping any of them will show you the posts that have that flair, you will want to sort by new to find the newest things however.

4. If you want to see the entire flair list, go back to step 2 and tap ""See More"".

You cannot flair filter properly with this app and it's considerably slower than others ~~so I'd recommend picking one of the ones below.~~ removed all dead third party clients from Reddits API change.

##Logged out Users (Desktop)

Some people can't log into Reddit but still browse and want to filter. You can do this most effectively on old Reddit as new Reddit will change your sorting preferences anytime you add a new flair to filter. Using this filtering system, you will see all **relevant** posts for the last 24 hours, effectively showing you the front page as it exists without whatever you're filtering.

You can do this by going to https://old.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=day

Once there, write `-flair:FLAIRNAME`, `-flair:FLAIRNAME`, `-flair:FLAIRNAME`and so on. Make use of the block quotes in the flair list above so that flairs with spaces in them filter properly.

3851,Does having an American flag on a flagpole make you think a home owner is racist?,"Edit 2: At first there was great discourse here, and I was really enjoying reading the varying viewpoints.  But at this point, I have to take a step back from reading comments and replying. 

As this goes on, it seems like it's really drawing more hateful and honestly, really sarcastic and shitty commentary from both sides. For those who've genuinely weighed in respectfully and honestly, regardless of how you felt, thank you. Those who shared personal experience, thank you. Those who were honest, and forthright, but not judgmental, thank you. 
However, to those of you who decided to name call me, private message me, and more, because I won't endanger my autistic 4 year old or the 10lb little infant I am cradling in my arms right now? You can honestly go kick rocks. I've covered my child with my body inside my car while it was beaten with baseball bats, praying the glass didn't break, while racist bigots attacked my car. Why? Because I wrote BLM on my windows and listed the names of just a few victims of police brutality on a poster board during what was supposed to be a peaceful protest. I've stood, alongside my family and friends, hand in hand, while men 3x my size screamed obscenities in my face, saying every disgusting thing they could about me, about the fact that I was there, about POC, anything to get a rise out of me. I've had three children (a friend's, we got separated) huddled behind me for safety while I did my best to hold them all together and protect them as I was swarmed by a crowd of ""proud boys"" for daring to stand in silence holding a simple sign at a protest... while they pushed, shoved, grabbed, pulled, at my body, while again, I'm shielding CHILDREN. All this and more. And this, yes, is NOTHING compared to what POC face during police interactions. 
But don't you DARE tell me I'm ""not an ally"" because I am. However, I am ALSO a mother. And like ANY mother, I HAVE to put the health and safety of my children first. I have to. That is what a decent parent, a decent person, of ANY race, color, or creed does. 
So you can take your flimsy definition of allyship and shove it. Because if it were you in my shoes, who've experienced what I have, who have children, I highly doubt you'd be so cavalier about their health and safety. If they were older? We could talk. If one wasn't neurodivergent and had no sense of danger, body awareness, etc. We could talk. If one wasn't a LITERAL FUCKING INFANT, we could talk. 
But they are. 
And when you shield your actual children or the children of others with your physical body, just hoping glass doesn't shatter all over them, or someone multiple times their size doesn't hurt them, all because you dared to get out from behind a computer screen and call out the injustices ramping up in the world, sit down and shut up. 

Again, to those who weighed in with level headed responses on every side of this commentary, thank you. I've very much appreciated reading your comments, getting all the different perspectives, hearing the different stories about why you feel the way you do, and the various meanings something as seemingly simple as flying a nation's flag has become so complex, and for some even problematic. I genuinely appreciate everyone who contributed in a constructive way, on every single side of this post. I appreciate you. I just have to step back for a bit because I'm honestly growing tired of the snarky, sarcastic, and even hateful vitriol coming from others. (Again, on both sides) 




Original post: It might sound silly, but I'm serious. 
I'm not racist by any means. I am fairly left leaning, politically. 

My husband and I just bought our first house and it's an old, 1800's home in a small, historic town. One street over is actually a building that was part of the underground railroad, and a town over there's a whole museum about it. The town has a really cool history. 

Anyway, our house has the stereotypical white picket fence, and has a flagpole in the corner. So while we have a LOT of work to do cleaning up this property (left to go to nature before we bought it), we love it and one of the first things we did was clean up the front yard a bit, clean up the fence, and put up an American flag.

Not two days later, I see a TikTok about how houses that display American flags are homes to racists anymore. And tons of people in the comments agreeing. I have to admit, it kind of surprised me. I didn't expect that. 

We already live right next door to a church and aren't religious at all (going to do our best to not offend them at Halloween but it's our favorite holiday and we decorate like crazy). 

But we don't want to come off as racist. Our style of home would look pretty with the classic style red, white and blue bunting around the porch, but again, we don't want to be putting off racist vibes lol

So help me out.  When you see a house with an American flag, do you assume they're racist? Or is this just a TikTok thing?

ETA: a lot of people have recommended adding a pride flag and/or BLM flag and I figured I'd put this here so I'm not typing it repeatedly. While we'd love to do that (I actually mentioned a pride flag when we bought the house) it would honestly be a potential safety issue. If you look up BLM protests in Bethel, Ohio on YouTube you'll see what I mean. That isn't the town we live in, but we aren't far, and I used to work on the street where all that was taking place. It made national news. 
You'll find posts about it on reddit too, even. 
Now, if it were just my husband and I, we wouldn't care so much if someone wanted to try to vandalize something or spout off the mouth. 
However, we have a 4 year old who is autistic and has no sense of danger and would trust pretty much anyone... and we have a very young infant. 
So while I love that idea and we are absolutely allies, we also have to be cognizant of the area we live in and the safety of our young kids. 
This is a small and beautiful town. 
But it also is a small town with one stop light but SEVEN churches. So...we have to kind of read the room. 

They're going to dislike us enough as it is, come Halloween when all the ""demonic"" decorations hit the yard lol",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x32c126b10>,1694796423.0,Me and my ex wife had an America flag.

3852,Why do people drive really loud cars/ motorbikes?,"I find loud cars/motorbikes incredibly obnoxious, and i immediately judge anywho who drives them, and assume that they are attention seeking and insecure. 

All of the people around me agree with this view, and I don’t know anyone who drives a loud car, and don’t feel bold enough to walk up to a Harley rider and ask “who hurt you king?”

This is above Reddit's pay grade.,81
3854,"Why is ""You look good/better without makeup"" generally taken negatively by women?","I sort of understand why saying ""better"" is negative since there is a comparison. However, almost any way you put it, commenting on a girls appearance post or pre makeup is taken negatively (from my experience at least). I've always meant it as a compliment. Isn't it so? I mean it's a celebration of her natural state. It's that even without it, you're still the beautiful girl I love.

edit: thanks for the help (even the passive aggressive comments). I’ve historically not been good with understanding women. I’m learning. But within the scheme of things I find it difficult to identify which generalisations I can make, and which ones I can’t. One of those is that “women don’t wear it for men”, which is a conclusion that I never came to logically. But I understand that now, I sorta compare it to working out as a man. I still believe you’re all conditioned to believe that makeup is a must just like we’re all conditioned to believe and want certain things. But if you argue otherwise, then is beautifying yourself part of the female essence? Whether it’s for yourself or for others, I’m now more inclined to believe so.",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x32c23bf50>,1694799227.0,"I could be off since I’ve never used makeup myself, but here’s what I think:
Makeup takes time, money, effort, and a
Level of artistry to select, procure, and apply it. Someone who uses it has put in this effort in order to enhance their appearance. So when they’re told that they look better without it, they’re hearing that all their effort and the artistic vision that went into their makeup is worthless, and that their taste in their own appearance doesn’t translate to others. That’s gotta sting a bit.",2346
3855,Why is sex seen as the ultimate thing?,"Edit: Okay, let me change the title: Why is sexuality and finding a partner the ultimate thing? 

My father found a new girlfriend not so long ago, and how he has changed is almost ridiculous. All that matters in his life now is just her. When I see him with her, he is just like a teenager that is high on some brain chemicals.

It seems an odd thing that so much time, energy and money is being spent just to fulfil a basic need. When you see people chasing after each other, ignoring everything else, it sometimes looks like complete madness.

I’m reminded of this quote by Sadh-guru I saw:

“When you were a child, what reproductive organs someone had did not matter to you. But the moment hormones started playing within you, you cannot think of the world beyond that. Your whole intelligence has been completely hijacked by your hormones.”

3857,"So, as a man, is it acceptable to approach women that I like? What’s the general consensus?","

I’m in my 20s and I’ve never approached a woman that I wanted to meet.  All my life, and especially in the last decade or so, I’ve heard plenty of women en masse talk about how creepy and unwarranted it is, and how they want to and should be left alone. 

But now, I’m seeing more & more  women come out and talk about how men don’t approach anymore and they don’t know what’s going on. Believe me, if I think you’re beautiful, I would love to approach and get to know you, but I don’t wanna get labeled a creep or blasted all over Tik Tok just because I tried to say hi. And when I’ve heard tons of those stories and seen endless videos like it, then best believe I’m gonna keep my head down and keep walking.

3864,Is there any actual concrete reasoning's to keep going?,"When someone wants to check out early and speed up their inevitable death, people always treat it as a bad thing. But why? I've never gotten a concrete reason why suicide shouldn't be considered.

Your parent would be sad? Okay what if my parents were abusive? What if my parents didn't give a fuck about me and rather I die? It's literally a reason why someone would want to kill themselves, because not only are they expected to carry on the same bloodline that they despise but they also have to suffer the effects of a broken childhood

In religion it's looked down upon. What if I'm an atheist who doesn't care? what if I want to just disappear into the void? And lets be honest, we all know that most religion is rewritten to suit the needs of whoever is the highest in the food chain. How convenient, when suicide is slowly becoming worse religion condemns it.

Because it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I thought depression never goes away, I thought my mental disorders would haunt me for the rest of my shit life but now when I'm thinking about ending it you guys instantly switch sides and say its temporary? Sure it will go away one day, but it will just come back harder than ever

Because you don't know if the future will be worse. Bullshit, I know me, I know how I will never give up my vices, I know how I behave, how I act, how I push away. I know that I will never change, and with the world slowly becoming worse and worse by the assholes who destroy the planet and rob us, why should I bring in the next generation? Is it because ""life is beautiful"" or were you told that you should push out the next generation so the upper class can have a new generation of gullible minds to trick and rob

So tell me, what actual reasoning is there to not commit suicide?

>reason is and ought only to be the slave of the passions

humans don't want people to suicide is because we aren't robots. We have a thing called feeling, we feel sorrow when some other suffers or does harms to one's self. 

the reason why people keep on going despite suffering is because we have a thing, nietzsche might call, Will To Power. That despite extraordinary suffering in whole of human history, humanity didn't give up and created value and meaning out of themselves.",2

3905,Does “hearing your partner” have a limit? Do you need to “validate” their feelings if what they’re saying is hurtful and objectively wrong?,"I, 34M, have struggled with mental health my whole life. I get anxiety about certain things and I’ve told my wife (34) this.

The last few days I’ve made a few mistakes while trying to do certain tasks due to being anxious. The mistake I made today was we were opening our hamster’s cage to put his sand bath in, it was my job to lift it and shut it but it got caught on the wheel and I got confused briefly so my wife had to tell me what to do (like show me where it got caught) to avoid our hamster getting out of the cage. In the end we were able to get the job done.

So afterwards we’re sitting on the couch and she starts asking me questions like “why do you get confused or tripped up over things like this?” And so I’m like “I don’t know” and she kept saying how she doesn’t like how she has to “bail me out” or “mommy” me in situations like this that I shouldn’t get so confused in, or that we have more of a “mommy-son” dynamic sometimes 

I said ok well we’re both gonna have certain things we’re good at and sometimes one of us will need to help the other out more… and she said “well I don’t feel like you ever do that for me though.” Which I took issue with because she does not have her drivers license meaning I do all the driving and also take her to and from work 3 days a week (she works 3 10 hour days). I also make her breakfast 3-4 times a week and before every work day, I help her pack up all her stuff for work and make sure she’s got everything etc. 

I brought this up to her to show her I definitely *do* do stuff for her and I’ve never made it sound like “oh I have to be your daddy and you’re my daughter” … I view it as me helping and serving my spouse which I would hope is how she views her helping me with stuff

She tried saying that her not having a drivers license doesn’t count as me “helping” her or “doing for” her because we mostly go to the same places together anyway, and that it’s not the same type of help that she gives me or whatever…

I did get a little defensive and said “honey, you’re 34 years old and you don’t have a license… this is definitely something I’m *doing* for you” 

I then said that I’ve had mental health issues my whole life and that I can’t help that sometimes I get anxious and freeze up in certain moments 

She then said that she didn’t know me getting confused about the hamster cage was a mental health moment for me. I guess I had assumed she made that connection because I’ve talked about mental health and anxiety so much in the past, but never actually said this type of situation was due to poor mental health too. I apologized and just assumed she knew.

So for part of the conversation I felt as though she was just being judgemental and I was getting a little defensive, but she was just asking questions and sharing her feelings because she literally didn’t know it was due to my mental health.

But the other thing she was upset about was that she said, “I was just trying to share my feelings with you about how you don’t help me with things, and you threw the fact that I don’t have a drivers license in my face” I did apologize about how I worded that, but said that her “feeling” like I don’t help her is… just objectively wrong, because I do, and gave those examples… but she insisted that it doesn’t matter what “facts” are, if she feels I don’t help her with anything I just need to listen and validate her feelings",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x32c5808d0>,1694838588.0,"Your wife sounds like a jerk based on what you’ve written here in this post.

3915,Should I [24M] send her [22F] a message?,"(tl;dr at the end)

A couple of weeks ago I matched with an awesome person on tinder, and we hit it off instantly. It’s the only time I’ve had a successful conversation on the app, and we decided to meet up. After that first date, things spiralled into a once-a-day kinky hookup thing, and she showed me a lot of stuff I didn’t know I was into. We both clicked very well out of the bed too, so we decided to become gf/bf. 

That whole first week was just going on dates and having sex, but we learned a lot about each other and the ways we think about things. We really liked each other.

On the drive home after we talked about being in a relationship, we talked about what we thought our red flags were - she has some family issues, and I have ADHD and am currently seeking work on the other side of the country as the options where we live are severely limited in my industry (I finished my degree last year).

After this the conversation spiralled into ‘what would happen to us if you found a job over there’ kind of stuff, and we were both really upset to figure out that it probably wouldn’t work out. We both took the suddenness of the breakup hard, we cried together in my car in between small conversations before she got out and I drove home. 

It has been one week since that night, and she never blocked me (I told her that I understood if she felt the need to block me, I wanted to let her cope with her feelings however she felt without me intruding)

Now the question:

Would I be breaking some kind of social code if I sent her a message asking how she’s holding up? Should I just leave her be and move on?


TL;DR
Met girl on Tinder, we clicked super easily and had an awesome first week, talked about our red flags just after agreeing we should be in a relationship, we find out it won’t work with my plans to find a job overseas (ADHD means long-distance relationships have fallen apart for me in the past).

The process for choosing a new nominee will be super messy! But it might be too close to election to replace the names on the ballot. Americans don't actually vote for a person, they vote for a slate of electors, who physically meet to cast their votes a little over a month after the general election (this is the electoral college). In practice you're casting your vote for the party you want to be president. In which case you'd still vote for your candidate of preference, knowing that the slate of electors pledged to them will ultimately make the decision, likely with direction of the party leaders. There are some state laws around so called ""faithless electors"" which will likely end up in court. This whole process will be super messy and lots of lawsuits will be filed. 

If the electoral college has already met and a Vice President-elect has already been chosen then the 20th amendment kicks in:

>If, at the time fixed for the beginning of the term of the President, the President-elect shall have died, the Vice President-elect shall become President.

3921,What can I do to stop being so afraid of confrontation?,"Hi everyone 

I (21M) suffer from severe social anxiety and am generally a pretty quiet person. I went through a situation today where I should have confronted someone but was subconsciously holding myself back. I work at a drugstore and something happened today where a customer and cashier got into a screaming match and another coworker who had just punched out got involved and started arguing with the customer. 

Both employees involved were younger women while the customer was a guy, and while they weren’t threatened or anything and were just arguing with the customer, I feel incredibly guilty that I didn’t step in and back them up or direct his insults/anger toward myself and off of them. 

Months ago one of the coworkers told me about a time a guy she was arguing with in the store was threatening her and none of the guy employees stepped in to help her, and I just kind of assumed if something like that happened I wouldn’t hesitate to step in.

The whole time I was standing around and didn’t really do anything. Because of my social anxiety I was standing there getting very tense and shaky and it felt like while I knew I probably should have said something I was subconsciously holding myself back.

I feel really bad that I didn’t help them out and I’m sure they probably look at me in a negative light for not jumping in and standing up for them. Plus as a guy I feel like I really just naturally should do so when another guy is berating a woman. 

Ultimately this is indicative of a much larger problem for me. People tell me all the time that I need to learn to stand up for myself, but my fear of confrontation has me back down at the slightest hint of possible escalation. 

Is there some way I can work on this? It doesn’t seem like something I can fix overnight but is something I want to actively work on. I’m hoping someone has been in my position and can offer some advice on how I can improve myself in this regard.

Another was taking up martial arts.  I'm not suggesting this so that, in this situation, you can intervene and fight the guy.  I'm suggesting it so that you can intervene and not be afraid of the guy getting physical.  It's a subtle difference perhaps, but very significant.

Let's get back to the lawyer thing.  A big part of that job was learning how to speak in public.  My courtrooms always had people in them, there were other counsel, court staff... so when I spoke, I had an audience.  It isn't like standing in front of a classroom and talking to 30 people, whatever their ages.  But pretty soon, I got to the point where I could give talks to school groups, and larger groups at conferences.

I wanted to shed some light on how contemporary disaster response operates, emphasizing the importance of need-based prioritization.

**Prioritizing Vulnerability:** In today's disaster response, the primary focus is on vulnerability. This means that individuals who are most vulnerable, regardless of their gender or age, receive immediate assistance. This category includes the elderly, people with disabilities, pregnant women, or anyone in immediate danger.

**Proximity to Danger:** Another critical consideration is proximity to the source of danger. Those closest to the danger often require immediate rescue, ensuring their safety regardless of gender.

**Resource Allocation:** Decisions are influenced by the availability of resources. The severity of the disaster and the resources at hand impact the order in which individuals are rescued.

**Fairness and Equity:** Modern disaster response strives to be fair and equitable. Discrimination based on gender, age, or any other characteristic goes against humanitarian principles.

**Disaster Triage Approach:** To efficiently allocate resources, responders use the Disaster Triage Approach. This method categorizes individuals into three groups - **Immediate, Delayed, and Minor** \- based on the severity of their injuries or medical needs, ensuring that those in critical condition receive prompt attention, regardless of gender or age.

Contemporary disaster response aims to maximize the efficiency of rescue efforts and save as many lives as possible. It does so by prioritizing need and vulnerability over gender or age. The Disaster Triage Approach further enhances this by focusing on medical urgency, ensuring that everyone's life is valued equally during a crisis.

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

In modern disaster response, prioritize saving lives based on need, not gender or age. Vulnerability, proximity to danger, and resource allocation guide our decisions. The Disaster Triage Approach categorizes individuals by medical urgency.

Discrimination isn't a part of contemporary disaster response.",2

This is a genuine question out of curiosity, i expect there not to be a hard in stone answer to it and more of a variety and i’m all for seeing different opinions.


So my question is :

Where do we draw the line of boundaries and body autonomy?

My morals would go as such : 

I don’t really care what people wear it’s none of my business, i do have boundaries about a significant other tho, if my girlfriend decided to start going outside naked, i wouldn’t be comfortable with it, but i also wouldn’t necessarily think she’s in the wrong because that’s her choice, but since i’m not confortable with it i would probably separate from her due to having different boundaries that don’t connect with one another.

Is it okay for me to have these boundaries if they make me uncomfortable?

Adding up : This isn’t necessarily to debate why we should be okay with men nipples and not women’s or whatever, i’m not comfortable seeing either unless in a proper social context (like the beach)

Backstory - I'm not complaining, I've had my fair share of intimate/emotional relationships in my life (25 M), but every one of those relationships has been with a girl that I particularly did not like at first or did not feel as attached to them as I would like. I've kind of had mostly FWB relationships with girls that I did not like, did not show any affection to them and in a way had a ""fuck it"" attitude towards them/relationships. I know people say girls/women like bad boys and that people always want that which they cannot have, but I like to believe couples married someone they fancy and someone who shows their affection to them. My problem is the following : every time I meet a woman which I genuinely like and want to pursue something more than sex and want to be a gentleman or show my affection, it never happens, but at the same time, every time I meet some woman who I only want to have sexual relationship with, they always catch feelings as some point, while I am generally looking for something else.

We met when I(F) was a week into being 18 and he was 24, things were fine for a year or so,  then I I had a horrible feeling he was cheating on me so I looked through his phone ( yes I know I probably shouldn’t have) and found many many photos and texts between one woman and himself. When he got in from work I confronted him about it as I was distraught, he denied it of course saying it was from long before we got together, even though the last messages and photos were from the month before.  He made me think I was going mad and I then went into shock I think and the evening carried on as normal, we went to the shop and got things for dinner, made dinner, I kept crying on and off and he ignored it. I didn’t speak all night. We then went to bed and he wanted to have sex, now I didn’t say no and I didn’t stop him but I laid there sobbing the whole time he was on top of me and cried myself to sleep after.

3998,Can you help me decipher the meaning of what my college teacher said to me?,"About 6 years ago, when I was in college, my teacher and I were having a side conversation about a project assignment. I remember being concerned about the quality of my work so far, and I was trying to get a better idea of what she expected. At some point in the short conversation she told me that my work would be fine, and then quite abrasively she looked at me and said “it’s not easy for everyone like it is for you.” I was mostly in shock surprise, but still managed to murmur something about how I think I work just as hard as everyone else at my studies. To which she replied something to the affect of “but it’s easier for you. Isn’t it?” And then more, proceeded to answer her own question with another statement “yes, it’s easier for you. You don’t have to try as hard as some people.” She seemed quite annoyed and I said nothing else. I never mentioned to her that I was worried about the quality of my work, but I suppose it was obvious with my nervous energy. 

The entire interaction caught me off guard and from that day on she seemed to be more so short tempered with me than anyone else in the class. I tried to ignore it but it became so difficult to deal with that I eventually left the program. This is something that has lived rent free in my head since it happened. The truth of that matter is that I did struggle very much so with the assignments. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder, c-ptsd, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Simply managing through the day is a challenge sometimes so doing extra was something that I had to fully dedicate myself to. There were times I would stay up all night long writing a paper, just to come in the next morning and see 3-4 students scribbling down their versions before time to present. Not that I am judging, if I felt like I could get away with that, I might have done the same. However, I knew I needed hours and focus to complete the assignment so I always did them in this way. 

6 years later and this interaction plays on repeat in my head. Why did she say this? What did I do to make her feel this way? What does someone forming a completely false opinion of me and being fully convinced of it say about me? What does it say about how I present myself? What does it say about my authenticity? What does it say about how difficult or easy I have accidentally made life for myself? If anyone has any insight I would be 6 years grateful.

4005,"I think my friend purposely posts ugly pictures of me on Instagram, what do I do?","Kind of a weird post here but I’m at a loss. I’ve been friends with this girl for about 2 years. We’re not super tight but part of a bigger friend group and we all get along well, I’ve never had a problem with her. 

Until a couple months ago when I started to notice a weird trend. Every time she posts on Instagram I’ll be in at least one picture, however, every single time, without fail, she chooses the absolute worst pictures of me. You know how group photos can be, and I know that odds are at least one person will look a little goofy, but I swear at this point I think she’s doing it on purpose. 

It’s been 6 posts now and every single one has at least one picture of me looking terrible. And it’s not some coincidence where the photos she happens to look the best I look the worst, cause I’ll go through the photos myself and find one where we both look great, her even better than the one she posted, and I always look fine in the photos my other friends post, I swear she just goes through the photos sent in our friend groupchat and chooses the one where I look the worst. 

Here’s the kicker. I compared her most recent picture to the actual picture another friend sent in the groupchat, and I swear to god she photoshopped my ass to look smaller. I screenshotted her post and compared it side to side with the original and she purposely made my butt look flat. Like no curve at all. I’m abhorred. 

I’m not like insecure or anything and I don’t care if there’s a picture of me on Insta where my face looks a lil goofy, but when it’s 6 goddamn posts and every single one I look like a gremlin, nah, this is a pattern. I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t want to approach her about it and come across as however I would, but I’m kinda just over it at this point. The last time our friend group hung out I straight up just refused to get in the group pic and rather took the picture myself. But I don’t wanna keep this up cause then I’ll lose out on pics with my friends :( I know this sounds like a silly insignificant thing but it kinda just irks me cause I feel this is 100% intentional and it’s lowkey making me self conscious.",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x32e5b9810>,1694662755.0,Sounds like she is threatened by you and wants to make you look bad,884

I was told I needed to enlist in National Guard, go to basic for the summer, and come back and then I would be in the simultaneous program. I swore in, my recruiter meeting me at 4am at the in-processing place. A few weeks later, I got a substantial scholarship to an overseas school, so I told my recruiter I no longer needed them. 

My recruiter, and the state school ROTC guy, got aggressive towards me, saying commitment blah blah blah, I skipped out on of the pre-trainings and my recruiter even showed up at my parent's house asking where I was (my parents called the cops on him). I finally asked my recruiter why they insisted I do the 8 week bootcamp, whereas everyone else in a graduate program just did a much shorter basic leadership training. He didn't really have a good answer, and I said ""well, ROTC doesn't really work if I am overseas, will it"" and I ghosted him/and the ROTC people.

How tf do I navigate this?,"I’m a Pakistani born and raised in London (24M) and since I was about 20 I became more conscious of my race/cultural background as when I was younger I didn’t think about it as much. In Britain at least, racism can be shown pretty plainly but it’s mostly done in subtle glances and comments. I’m an activist and most others are, as you can expect, are people who come from a white and middle class background. Strangely, more and more I feel a sense that I’m not welcome there, even when these people are generally progressive. Sometimes it’s been obvious like the group I was in lowkey using me as a mouthpiece for their anti racist campaigns, tokenism type of thing. 
I try to not let this bother me, there’s worse kinds of racism out there obvs but with this “liberal” crowd I always get the feeling that they’re really uncomfortable with me being there. Idk if it’s some silly white guilt or what. Talking about it with other POC’s I kind of just get the response “you’re just insecure about your race” or that I just shouldn’t care or that I’m intentionally victimising myself and obvs my white friends will listen but they won’t get it.

Main thing I’m asking is if others can see if what Im feeling here is valid ig? And not just some paranoia. Not just with activists types but with people you’d more or less see as normal or not racist. At work or back at uni and school it’s easier to tell but socially I find it hard.

So I've always had a crazy stomach and now I'm worried that my one consistent vice/crutch that makes life tolerable with my mental health issues(they are professionally treated/medicated as well) is causing me problems and I'll have to give it up because I have no choice and idk what to do without it or how I can be comfortable cause I remember counting down the days before I could start using at 18 cause my mental health was just atrocious and it's always been there since and helped me just function normally and I'm terrified to the point of tears that I'll have to face my mental health raw again cause my panic attacks used to be so bad they'd send me to the ER for false heart attacks, and my depression made me less motivated and do nothing more than I do now so I'd really like some opinions.

Tl;Dr: I'm(21M) worried but not sure I have chs since I use a lot of cannabis but also have a genetic and personal history that stems much longer than my weed consumption of my stomach being awful and I've recently been doing things that would make it upset tbh like my diet being more crazy and junk and sleep schedule being nocturnal mixed alot with extra stress, my stomach also gets really sick from my back hurting and how I lay on my back sometimes, and I've gone cold turkey with my psych meds and cigs.

If anyone can give me a ELi5 of the entire situation, that'll be great",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x32e7f2310>,1694738758.0,"""It takes a lot to unite all corners of the gaming industry, but Unity has done just that with an astonishingly bad change to the pricing for the use of its game engine, the biggest rival to Epic Games’ Unreal Engine.

Unity announced that it would now be charging developers for use of the engine per installation of their game. The stunning change freaked out countless indie developers, and many already announce their intention to switch platforms for in development or future releases.

Unity rushed to try to clarify some of the most common questions this move raised, which as Axios reports, includes:

Originally, the announcement said that every install would warrant a fee, meaning players could delete and reinstall a game multiple times to mess with developers. They have since said that it will only be charged on the initial installation, but that does not cover multiple platforms like an install on both PC and Steam Deck.
As for piracy, Unity says they have their own fraud protection tech that they say developers will need to trust so they’re not getting charged for pirated copies.
Demos of the game will not be charged a fee as long as they’re not included with the full game.
Charity bundles including games will not be charged a fee, but the developer will have to inform Unity about the inclusion to make sure that actually happens.
Unity says that for games being offered on a subscription service like Game Pass, it would not be the developer being charged for the installs, it would instead be Microsoft who has to pay. Microsoft has not had any response to this, and it seems likely it had no idea this was supposed to be the case.
Despite some clarifications, no one is celebrating this move. It feels deeply backward, and there will likely remain a flood of developers who flee to platform to Unreal or other engines in order to avoid this kind of install fee-based model that has arrived out of nowhere. Some are wondering if Unity, which has lost half its value in the last five years, will be able to survive in the long term if this is what they’re resorting to in order to increase revenue.""",3

4073,Why are moderates voting Republican in the national elections at all?,"I'm fairly conservative fiscally and socially. I believe in less government meddling in people's lives. I couldn't care less about the Mexican border, something about a laptop, back the blue, gender, LGBTQ, BLM.  Not that I don't think some of those issues are messed up but I don't have the capacity to care about them when I have my own issues in my own life and all of those other issues have near zero impact on myself.

I usually vote for independent/non-partician or conservatives candidates in local elections for the county/town/city because they aren't concerned about MAGA or whatever the heck they're on.  In the national stage its a COMPLETELY different story. Trump is the most corrupt politician I've seen, it made what Nixon did look like a non-issue. When it comes to anything that deals with the national election, presidential/senatorial/congressional, I always vote for the candidate who isn't on the Trump cult and they're often Democrats.

Also the Republican in the National stage are BIG GOVERNMENT that meddle with everything, education, people reproductive choice, marriage, etc. I could care less if two guys get married. I dont approve of gay marriage so I'm not going to get married to a guy. I could care less if someone else does thats their business and not a place for government to meddle in.

I did find their food to be better on average than most American schools I’ve been in. At least the school I was at. But I’ve also seen some good food in American schools, especially some private schools or charters. 

But when you see a tray and it has like an apple and a shitty looking cheeseburger and that’s it, I don’t even know where those places are. It might not even be accurate, because it’s not like you only get one option. Just about any school has a cafeteria with options, and it’s up to you to pick what’s available for the day. 

So that picture of a shitty Apple and cheeseburger may be shitty, but it’s also quite possible that’s literally what the kid chose to get and then is upset with it lol. 

But it varies quite a bit by school and district, contracts with food vendors and the amount of money a school chooses to spend, or just doesn’t have as much money to spend on food.

It also varies by grade. Elementary grades have different food options most often than what they’ll serve in a high school.",3

For the last five months, my mental health has been great. I have been happy, hopeful, and optimistic. But for the past two days I've had a weird feeling, like this moment is the ""beginning"" of something and I don't know what the something is. 

I spent 2021 and most of 2022 with a lot of issues.

It's more complicated than that because I thought I was traveling to the 10th dimension and I was receiving messages from music and numbers (and the messages would all say different things for my destiny). 

I got out of it through my faith and letting go of the things that were holding me back. For five months I have been so hopeful and bright, and my family is so happy because they didn't think I was going to survive before.

English is not my first language so sorry if I do some mistakes i'm still practicing.

so I had a school year with a boy who we were close to(he was 15 and i was 16), we both knew we liked each other but we never said it out loud,  there was a real chemistry something really special and attractif and natural like we communicated with the eyes I don't know how to explain it but it was obvious from the start, we never admitted it to ourselves and just chose the easy way, that is to live in the moment and pretend there is absolutely nothing but enjoy anyway 
(we never touch each other or anything like that knowing that he was in a relationship it was out of the question I respect her girlfriend, it was really in the eye that we understood each other, we didn't even need to say it out loud) 

we lost contact at the end of the year obviously none of us tried, it's been 5, 6 years and I never really thought about him I know it's going to seem strange after I said that  there was something special, something incredible but I really stopped thinking about him, neither try to contact each other.

 but since the end of this year of classes I haven't stopped having dreams with him in them, they are simple dreams where I  just live my life in really banal contexts on everything and anything like going shopping or going for a walk and I'm always with him, I don't have the face of the person concerned it's even very blurry,  but I know that it's him, i juste feel it, i never ask myself the question as if it just obvious.
 yet in everyday life I never think about this person, it is only recently that I really ask myself the question, how and why and above all what to do? because it's been going on for 5 years.

I know I'm going to sound really crazy but I have no desire to send him a message or contact him again + the fact that he's still in a relationship with the same girl from 5 years ago (I did some research this morning because of another dream but im not sure about that)

The fact that he's still in a relationship with the same girl he was 5 years ago makes me doubt the fact that maybe I'm just making films for myself but on the other hand it's really something that  we had without even saying it to each other, I am convinced of it, I really feel it and I have always felt it.

4098,"Sexual performance anxiety is ruining my sex life, anyone got any advice to overcome it?","Hi everyone, feeling a bit lost here - long story short I (21M) have been avoiding sex for the past three years due to a crippling fear of losing my erection / not being able to get an erection, this is largely due to my first few sexual encounters being wildly uncomfortable with that exact scenario coming to fruition. With my first girlfriend it took 5 months of trying to even have PIV sex, as my penis was just never cooperating. Second girlfriend my penis worked fine because she was rarely ever horny so it goes down to that whole “humans want what they can’t have” so I never had an issue in that relationship. However after that relationship fell through I didn’t seek out sex for about 3 years which brings me to today. I know for a fact I’m not gay, and asexuality doesn’t seem like an option either as when I’ve had sex in the past I’ve absolutely loved it, only when I’ve been completely relaxed.

I recently went on holiday with a really good (female) friend of mine who I never really saw as anything more than a friend, however one night we all of a sudden both developed strong feelings for eachother, and ended up sharing a bed together. At first I was extremely up for sharing this with her, as she ticks all the boxes for me as a perfect girlfriend and a relationship with her would (in my opinion) be absolutely perfect. As soon as it got down to anything happening though, I got massively in my head and whenever I’d get an erection, and her hand would touch my penis etc, it’d instantly disappear. She is very understanding and has told me numerous times she’s absolutely okay with taking things slow, but I still couldn’t seem to shake the sheer uncontrollable nerves.

Fast forward to this week, it’s been a week since we’ve been on holiday and we’ve met up twice at her house just to watch some movies and stuff, nothing sexual planned. Yet I still feel this immense pressure to even just get a boner! It’s gotten to a point where when we kiss eachother, I’m so stuck in my head that I can’t even feel anything, I just almost feel numb, it’s so frustrating as all I want is to make sure this goes perfectly as she’s absolutely ideal for me on paper, it just feels like my body has flipped a switch and completely turned off my sex drive, I don’t even have the urge to masturbate anymore, nor am I even getting boners by myself due to this massive pressure I’m putting on myself all of a sudden this week, a complete shift from the weeks before the holiday where I’d be doing it 3-4 times a week. 

I’ve been considering taking some viagra to overcome the initial hurdle and see if I can shift sex into a positive light in my head, because at the moment, whenever even a remotely sexual moment arises, all my brain can focus on is “why am I not hard” and it’s all I can think about.

Lots of you will say “oh you’re just not sexually attracted to her” etc but I really don’t think that’s the case - as initially before the anxiety set in, I was very much up for taking her to bed - I’m just really in my head and looking for answers.

If she is understanding just take it slow. The best thing you can do is talk to her about it, I mean you have little choice, she'll either find out during or before and it's better to be up front. It seems like it wont happen because you've built it up in your head to be this heavy wall but just sit next to her, hold hands, cuddle, kiss a little with no expectation of anything happening further.

I had an issue not with getting an erection but not cumming too soon. I would cum as soon as she sat on my lap, still clothed just gentle dry humping would do it.

Some people, to some extent my autistic self included, can in my view just never shed a smidge of awkwardness in whatever they do.

My brother has this awkward streak 50x worse than these popular youtubers, and I'd argue much worse than me - yet he's much more socially popular than me, and is a strange mix of much more and much less uninhibited.

What I HEARD is that her family was super excited about their love and relationship. 

Her parents continue to work full-time jobs and their daughter and now husband work menial jobs (retail worker and driver) but live luxurious lives. The only explanation here is they’re living off her generational wealth.

Because without knowing their life exactly by judging someone there it's like you're gatekeeping their relationship and life. Or why isn't it like that? It just seems hypocritical at this point if people should have full autonomy and freedom why would we hold people to old ideas of fidelity just because that's what we decide is important still for traditional or even common sense reasons?

Because it's easy to say people should never cheat they should just break up/divorce, but how many women feel they can't break up/divorce for their safety?

Listen to that self-hate, argue with it, and find out what you can do about that hate, or if you should do something about that hate.

I (21) am really far behind on learning to drive. When I turned 18 and Covid hit everything shut down so I had an excuse to avoid learning to drive because I was admittedly really lazy and also nervous about it.

After waiting for as long as I possibly could, I got to the point where I couldn’t put it off anymore and I’ve taken three driving lessons so far with two more planned before I take my road test. My instructor said after two more I’ll be ready, but my anxiety about failing the road test has really been getting the better of me. 

I know if I do fail I can just retake it until I pass, but because of my crippling anxiety I get the fear I’ll be stuck in an endless cycle and I won’t be able to just get it over with.

Anxiety in general is something I really struggle with and it’s gotten to a point where I should seek professional help for it, but I know something like a road test tends to make a lot of people anxious so I’m hoping to hear from people who were in my position to see how they handled the anxiety. I’d really appreciate any help anyone has to help me combat my anxiety over this. Thank you!

Edit: also I just want to say that I’ve made posts on here before but this is something that I really am truly afraid to discuss because it’s really embarrassing for me that I’m my age and do not have my license yet. I say this to bring up the fact that this is a pretty sensitive topic for me that I’m pretty embarrassed to talk about, so thank you in advance for handling this in a way that helps me avoid the embarrassment.",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x32f5c7c50>,1694662541.0,"It’s been a while, but I remember practicing a lot.

That’s how I work through my anxiety: practice the thing I’m anxious about doing. It doesn’t make the anxiety go away, but it does make the anxiety more manageable.

Good luck with your road test!",1

Some of my close friends are smoking hot. My closest friends are decidedly on the ugly side of the scale. I've got the whole scale in my roster

The person looking lonely has to give me a reason to care and bring them into my social circle. Approach me first, or be doing something cool that attracts my attention that could be a conversation starter. 

I don't know you. Maybe you're lonely because you're shy and new. Maybe it's because you're awkward. Maybe it's because you're a dick. Maybe we're not compatible as friends

4154,Do most guys really not know how to make friendships with girls and only think about the possibility of a Romance/sexual relationship with them?,"There is a rant down here that you may want to read in case you’re wondering why I as a guy find this so absurd, but for a TL’DR, 
I’m asexual and demi romantic and I was raised in Asian-American values and always told to respect everybody no matter what, and I took it to heart, I have many female and male friends and I treat them both just about the same, seeing that some other guys going wild over not being able to grasp a normal friendship with a girl is actually confusing me more than anything, and is it a common occurrence?

This question came to me when I read a comment on a thread about things men were surprised to learn about women, a couple of comments like “they actually like to talk about stuff and be treated like normal people” and I just…WHAT? Do some guys really not know this?? That one might be hyperbole, but I also see a lot of people talking about dudes only talking to girls in hopes they can be their girlfriend and dip immediately when they find out they have a boyfriend like it’s expected? Is this actually commonplace???
 I don’t doubt it happens sometimes but is it common???  I also watch a lot of asmongold because I think he’s a funny guy and he made a video about the Shoeonhead’s video on male loneliness, and he also said a lot of stuff about a lot of dudes only talking to girls or caring about them just so they can fuck them and I use can’t wrap my head around it! Is this really what lust does to people, I’m just reading this shit and I feel glad I’m asexual cause I’m utterly disgusted by this. Do people not see how cool friendship is sometimes?! It’s so goddamn underrated! 
I didn’t grow up with any of this either, my family never made it so that spouses could only have friends on the same gender and they generally looked down upon people who would only befriend people for the sake of romance of sex, and that’s just how I was raised, to make friend with whoever you like and treat everyone with respect.

I’m just a confused little man going into the big wide world and maybe realising my family are the few sane people alive, in America at least. I understand there are mental differences between men and women but they can’t be that goddamn different that it warrants crazy shit like this. Maybe it’s the asexuality and Demi romantic talking in me talking, I really can’t know. thank you for reading this ramble, I hope this made sense, haha.

There are a multitude of tests and ways to test for drugs/substances that all have varying degrees by which they can detect things over time. 

The main way DAT testing is done is via urine strip tests.  They are quick, cheap and very effective at catching use.  Many drugs can be out of your system in days, but others, which as THC stay detectable for weeks or months depending on level of use. 

If your urine flags a positive, they will run a confirmatory test via a method called Mass Spectrometry. This uses light to show the chemical content and concentration that of substances in fluid.   These tests are VERY sensitive and accurate. 

Another method would be hair sampling which looks back as much as 90 days in some instances. 

The other issue your going to potentially have is CDT. Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin  is used widely in Europe to evaluate people for chronic drinking over the past 2-3 weeks.   This is done when joining military, getting CDL, life insurance, etc. 

CDT is elevated by n patients that consume greater than 40g or alcohol per day over time. This equates to about 4/5 drinks depending on type etc.    please note that this drinking needs to be consistent and chronic over time.  A few drinks a few days a week isn’t going to elevate CDT. 

Once a person stops drinking, the levels go down over a few weeks.   Now- this isn’t to say they won’t catch heavy drinking as they can look at liver enzymes too, but CDT is a specific marker for alcohol abuse.",2

Car insurance costs are based mostly on the driver and other drivers like them. Why is this legal for insurnace but not for other things? Or conversely, why isn't it illegal for insurance?",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x33026b910>,1694616413.0,"It's legal for insurance because the law often says it is legal. In Ontario for example, the Human Rights Code says:

> 22 The right under sections 1 and 3 to equal treatment with respect to services and to contract on equal terms, without discrimination because of age, sex, marital status, family status or disability, is not infringed where a contract of automobile, life, accident or sickness or disability insurance or a contract of group insurance between an insurer and an association or person other than an employer, or a life annuity, differentiates or makes a distinction, exclusion or preference on reasonable and bona fide grounds because of age, sex, marital status, family status or disability.

The reason insurance has some exceptions is because it backed by actuary science. Other parts of society lack that cold and hard statistical foundation. Men are legitimately and mathematically more expensive to insure than women in car insurance. The government (supported by the courts) agree that this is discriminatory, but they don't necessarily want to force insurance companies to lose money either. Insurance is an important of a healthy economy and the government does not want to jeopardize the viability of insurance.

In Canada, we try to balance that out with a two-pronged test:

> To satisfy the subjective element, a qualification or requirement having a discriminatory effect must have been imposed honestly, in good faith and in the sincerely held belief that such a limitation ""is imposed in the interests of the adequate performance of the work involved ... and not for ulterior or extraneous reasons..."" To satisfy the objective component of the test, it was necessary to show that the qualification or requirement was ""reasonably necessary to assure the efficient and economical performance of the job..."" (*Zurich Insurance Co. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission*)

In short, as long as the insurance is not discriminating because of some type of dislike of the group, and as long as their is actual financial benefit of doing so, the discrimination is valid. However, the Supreme Court of Canada also suggests that efforts be made to find a different model for insurance companies to follow that does not discriminate on protected groups. If there is a insurance model that is non-discriminatory and allows for the same financial benefit of the discriminatory one, the non-discriminatory one must be taken.",1

4207,Is touch-deprivation real?,"What I mean is, do people feel uneasy or restless when they aren't in an intimate relationship that features touch for a long period of time?

This same chef asked me “do you think you are actually a kind person who cares about people’s well being  or just friendly to get along and make life easier”.And I found that question so weirdl I never said I was nice to him.

4209,$15k personal loan with 15% APY paid off early within 6 months and no prepayment penalty. How much total is paid?,"I’m struggling finding a proper calculator online or way to solve this. 

Let’s say you got a $15k usd loan, 15% APY, term is 3 years to pay it back. There are no prepayment penalties. 

So every month instead of making the minimum payment you pay $2.5k usd instead towards paying back the loan. 

In the end, how much do you end up paying in interest?

I understand that talking about sex is awkward, but it's appalling that so many women were MARRIED OFF without even knowing the 's' of sex. Wouldn't it be a horrifying experience to have your newlywed husband remove yours and his clothes and shove his privates into yours for no apparent reason? And the women would be scared senseless for both to enjoy the sex.

4226,Egos and double standards?,"Currently I am afraid to ask my partner about this, but it’s becoming a more prevalent imbalance in our relationship and I would love some outside perspectives. 

To start- my partner is an aggressive extrovert while I consider myself an aggressive introvert.  He is much lore likely to make boisterous jokes at the expense of other than I am, while I occasionally try out such a form of humor. Other than that, I don’t make jokes about people I don’t like- I state the facts, and only to the people I feel I can absolutely trust. 

The dynamic that has been troubling me is how he will make jokes at the expense of my age (he is older than me), my habits or my interpretation of certain things (such as differing opinions on political/ethical/pragmatic issues) where I cannot tell if he is being sarcastic, playing the devils advocate or simply trying to put me down. 

For reference, recently he was teasing a friend and myself about the phrase “cutting a rug”. I didn’t care much about it, but in response my friend and I began to make jokes about him being older which is why we weren’t familiar with the phrase.  We both got the silent treatment following our jokes towards him. 

Then most recently I was giving him a foot massage and he said something a long the lines of “if you keep giving me foot massages like these I’ll keep hiking up mountains with you” (which for some background I love hiking up challenging routes and he’s not the biggest fan, and I found this comment hugely romantic). In response I said “well you’ll have to find something to do for me so I will keep golfing with you” (he has introduced me to golfing this summer, which I am honestly enjoying, I was just hoping to get a massage out of it).  He immediately accused me of making an ultimatum.  Where if he seemingly didn’t do something I wouldn’t golf with him (absolutely not the case).  Which confused me because in my mind I was carrying on with a playful banter, yet to him I was making some sort of attack.  Which in the end he fell asleep while I massaged his feet. 

No sure if anyone else is familiar with this dynamic and has any insights?  I am not trying to fuel a fight, I am jus trying to understand the dynamics
of the ego, which I assume is the primary reason a significant other might respond this way? Where they can make jokes at everyone’s expense yet no one else can do the same to them?

If not, that’s a big red flag.

I have a decent savings, and I feel extremely lucky and fortunate to be able to say that when I know many people do not. 

For most of my 20’s, I worked hard and climbed the corporate ladder - changing roles every 1-2 years to get to the salary I make now. Yet my pay feels basically equivalent to when I was making 20k less than this a couple years ago, and I fear the bleeding has only just begun.

I know we’ve all heard about it and been living it for a while now - the inflation, shrinkflation, and corporate greed destroying the middle class…
The cost of groceries, the astronomical rent prices, the interest rates, the price hikes, the dollar being worth less and less…

Owning a home I’d feel even semi-proud of feels like an abstract pipe dream at this point. I used to want kids, but now I don’t because not only do I feel I couldn’t provide for them, but I don’t know if I see an end to this situation - what world will they need to navigate that’ll be even more defeating than the one I am currently navigating? There are other reasons I stopped wanting them, but I digress…

Rent, groceries, utilities, student loans, car loans, etc. are eating everyone’s take home pay. Inflation rose infinitely higher than wages ever did, or likely ever will. 

“You will own nothing and be happy.”

I see everywhere online whether it’s here on Reddit, tiktok, Instagram, Twitter, etc. the sentiment of “we need to get together and demand change” but what does that truly look like? What can anyone actually do? 

We’re told to vote to influence change, but every election cycle seems to result in either career politicians that shed their skin once voted in, or as we saw as of late - the cartoonishly ridiculous (both in different ways) choice of Trump or Biden. 

Any policy enacted that’s been “good” for the middle class has been at best, a band-aid on a bullet wound. 

The rich will always have the money and resources to sway the world in their favor. I know I sound entirely pessimistic and nihilistic, but I’ve lost touch with those feelings not being realistic relative to the world we live in. Even if we found a way to turn the tables, change likely won’t happen quickly.

So, truly, what can we even do? Does anyone believe there’s a light at the end of this tunnel?

Another exemple would be to tell someone that drugs and stuff are very cool and that they should definitely try some, but not just softdrugs but something crazy that'll likely end up causing your death.

Like it's kinda only telling a lie, and then letting the child decide how to act on it, so if that's something dangerous then what exactly do you punish that person for?

4278,I have reoccurring deja vu/memories of four specific places I’ve never been. Why?,"I have frequent (at least once a month), reoccurring deja vu/flashbacks to four specific, detailed places I have certainly never been. 

It’s so specific I could paint a picture of each place. It’s always from the same perspective. 

As an example, the first place I had this feeling about is an empty, dark, dusty, industrial looking school with thickly painted  blue-gray stairs. I’m apprehensively, almost sluggishly approaching them. My feet scuff the edges of the stairs as I ascend. I turn the corner in a brick lined corridor, my fingers skipping over the gap in the metal handrail.  The streaked, dust-coated windows lining the far wall show that it’s late evening, early night. Other industrial buildings and lights  loom in the distance but nothing is distinguishable. The sun is down and I’m facing the green chalkboard. There is a battered, light oak teacher’s desk to my left and scattered antique looking school desks behind me. The overhead light flickers but doesn’t make any noise. It smells like old wood and chalkboard dust. The baseboard heaters that stick out from the walk kick on and I jump…


I know it sounds like an essay, but I’m trying to describe in enough detail how vivid this is for me. 

I have diagnosed PTSD, but this isn’t like any other flashbacks I have. It’s completely different. It may be worth noting that I feel/remember separate.. I don’t know.. emotional states.. in correlation with each place. 

I’ve tried googling this and I’ve had trouble finding much that seems related to this. I’ve read about false memories, but this doesn’t feel the same. I am consciously aware that I myself was not in these places, yet I am still viewing them from a first person perspective.

When you have an insecurity you should work on your relationship with it. No one does this anymore. People just hope no one ever notices it and get offended when a joke is made. Chris didn't call her ugly, or make a much worse joke about her fucking her son's friend.

Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up quite so much so I’m going to add a few things. First off, castration can include the wang too. “The term castration may also be sometimes used to refer to emasculation where both the testicles and the penis are removed together. In some cultures, and in some translations, no distinction is made between the two.” ~ from the wiki page on castration. 

Secondly, a lot of comments asking about barbaric, draconian, corporal punishments. Practices of a civilized society and so forth. Frankly, if rape is commonplace enough to require these measures then the society has failed in its duty to its people and requires harsher penalties. My contribution would be to bring back the public aspect of this. Televise this shit. Associate public shaming with the crime and the next time a rapist considers assaulting someone they just might hesitate if they’re able to visualize the consequences. Is it civilized? No, but perhaps it would be a step back on the path to civility.

4299,What is the smell coming from my roommates room.,"It all started yesterday when I was sitting in my room headphones on watching YouTube. I caught a whiff of something kind of stanky and when I went into the hall to investigate, it had changed from mild stank to downright vile. I deduced that the smell was coming from one of my 3 roommates bedroom. I texted one of my other roommates and after describing the smell he came home to make sure I wasn’t exaggerating about how bad it was. When he discovered how god awful it actually was we decided to spray some air freshener and see if that made it go away. It did not. About 10 minutes later the roommate to whom the stench belonged exited his room, and I shit you not the smell tripled in strength when he opened his door. My other roommates and I decided that we would confront him the next day if the smell was still there. Next morning sure enough the smell is still awful, so we knock on his door to talk to him and he peaks his head out and asks what’s up. We tell him we’re smelling something offensive coming from his room area and ask what’s going on, he responds with something along the lines of “I don’t smell anything and I showered a couple days ago” and goes back in his room. We decide that we can’t keep living with this heinous smell and we go the the dorm RA to get him to do something. He walks in and immediately smells the awful aroma permeating our room, he says that this is definitely a problem and somebody higher up will be over in the morning to look in his room. 



TLDR: Roommate has vile smell coming from room and RA smelled it and says someone will be over tomorrow to look in his room and see what’s causing the smell.



So the question is, what the holy heck is making this repulsive smell.



Edit: Alright I’m going to try to sleep because I got shit to do tomorrow, I’ll update in the morning.



Morning Update: The smell is about the same strength but I think he took a shower while I was asleep. I don’t know what time dorm staff will be here but I will update when they go into his room. In the meantime I’ll do my best to respond to as many people as possible.



Afternoon Update: Alright y'all we went to the RA to expedite the process of figuring this shit out and she basically played conflict mediator. She had us write up a roommate agreement about maintaining cleanliness in our rooms. So now we're all cleaning our individual rooms and he has his door shut cleaning his. At the end of the conversation the RA asked him if he would be okay with her entering his room and he said that he was capable of finding the smell himself. So many of you have said that it's a body that I cant help but start to believe it.


5:35 PM PST: I've enlisted the help of my roommate to help answer all the questions about the specifics of the smell, as there have been a lot of questions. If you want a more thorough description of the smell or chain of events relating to the smell, you can PM u/Skunkworks150 



9:00 PM PST: This is gonna piss a lot of you guys off, it definitely pissed me off. We talked to multiple RA's who gave us a really long and bullshit filled talk about how they technically can't enter his room without permission from a certain person who is kind of the head of dorm operations. So Skunkworks and I decided that tomorrow after his exam we're going to face to face talk to the big man in charge and get him to smell the room. It doesn't seem that some of the RA's are taking us very seriously, the exception is the ones that actually smell it. Once people smell it they can tell that something ain't right. So tomorrow if getting the dude with key rights into the room and smelling it doesn't work then Skunkworks and I really have no choice other than call the non emergency police line.



I would like to say that this has been a very interesting Friday for me and Skunkworks, in fact he's been in his room with 2 cans of monster diligently answering all of your questions . At least all the questions that aren't creepily asking for pictures with a brand new account. You know who you are. There will be more updates tomorrow morning when we have the man with the keys come and experience first hand what we're going through. Goodnight everybody.



9:44 PM PST: I thought the last update would be all for the rest of the night until the smell evolved. I went to get some water from the living room and when I walked past the room there was a distinct sourness to what was already a god awful smell. Skunkworks can confirm that the smell is undergoing some sort of mutation, this night will be a bad one.



12:20 PM PST: So we decided that we should at least talk to the roommate to which the smell belongs with a more forceful attitude before bringing out the big guns. We knocked on the door and told him straight up that we wanted to go in and give him one more chance for redemption before we potentially made it a bigger deal than it needed to be. During the conversation we got clarification that he definitely cant smell it, and since many of you suggested that he cant smell at all I asked if he has had a history of not smelling things that other people clearly smell. He said no, so I suggested that maybe a bird or rodent had died in his air vent and asked him if he would let me in to get on a chair and take the vent off. Now I didn't really suspect that there was anything in there but this would provide Skunkworks and I with an opportunity to get a better look at what was going on inside. While I was in there the smell was very intense, and I knew it wasn't from the vent because my head was up there and nothing but clean air was coming out. But to prolong our stay in the room I took the vent off and used my phone flashlight to look around, there was nothing. After putting the vent back on I asked him if there was any way he dropped any kind of food item under his bed or behind his desk and he said he's sure that he didn't but will check since we're making a big deal out of it. I thought that was the end of the conversation so I got ready to call the head of the dorm when he came into the hall and said that he believes that he found the source of the smell and was going to sanitize whatever it was (he didn't specify because we think he might be embarrassed). Now its a matter of waiting and seeing if the smell goes away. I'll update again to confirm whether or not the sanitation worked.



1:44 PM PST: Skunkworks and I decided that it would be cool to make a discord so we can talk to you guys so here you go https://discord.gg/ECh5kSA



6:10 PM PST: Alright guys this is looking like the grand finale, Skunkworks and I discovered the source of the smell. So after we did some talking with people on the Discord we went to the roommate and had a fairly long conversation with him about how he needed to eradicate the smell, not just try to cover it up by cleaning. We told him that we didn't care what it was we just needed him to tell us what the fudge was going on. He told us that while he was looking for the source of the smell he put his nose inside of one of his snow boots and found that it had a slight odor. Skunkworks said he would take one for the team and sniff the boots in order to determine if it was the same smell, but when the boots were brought into the hallway it was immediately obvious that they were the source no up close sniff required. The smell was just like we described in previous comments and responses. But like 100x worse. It was eye watering and it made me want to gag. He said that he was planning on cleaning the shoes but Skunkworks and I really didn't want the source of the smell to continue to live. We sat him down and after some conversation convinced him to just straight up throw them away. He took them outside and Skunkworks and I assumed that he threw them in the dumpster. We waited a few hours to see if the smell went away and I'm happy to report that it is about 90% gone. There is still some remaining whiffs and the area around his door is still a little putrid but the dorm as a whole smells WAY better.


This has been a wild ride, and I want to thank everybody who tried to help us determine the source of the smell. I know a bunch of you guessed feet or shoes so congrats, if there was a prize you would have won it. To all you sick people that guessed things I wont write here, I'm glad you were all wrong.

4300,COVID-19 has me lonely and I am thinking of picking up video gaming but don’t know how to start,"Hello all. 

I am an older gentleman who lives alone in the Pacific Northwest. I am retired and as such, I have a lot of time on my hands. Ordinarily, I used my time to volunteer at the Boys and Girls Club and partake in some hobbies outside the home. Or else I feed the homeless. Most of the homeless are no longer hungry where I live though, so I will probably quit that.

With Coronavirus causing my state to go into quarantine, I am forced to spend quite a few hours alone at home.

I don’t want to get a dog, because they smell. A mink would remind me too much of my now deceased wife (she sort of looked like a mink.)

I am a widower of 9 years and my children and grandchildren live across state lines and are unable to visit. Plus my grandson is mostly into “dabbing” and smoking chronic.

To stave off the loneliness, I thought I may pick up a new hobby. I’ve been told by Caden, my grandson, that video games are an immersive experience these days (a far cry from when they started as “Pong” ha!)

I’d like to give it a whirl. I am looking for recommendations for video games that can be picked up by a novice easily. Something like checkers but easier. 

I do have some athletic prowess (can you say SHUFFLEBOARD.)

As I understand it, I can play these games on a personal computer or I can purchase a video game console. Is there any benefit to purchasing the console?

Thank you in advance,
Glenn",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x332874210>,1585269252.0,"Hello Glenn!

Video games can be a nice way to pass time, because they give you challenges and also rewards while looking nice.

For starters, since you seem to be adept with a normal laptop, I would recommend you to get some games on there.

A very well known program for getting games is called ""Steam"", which has a logo of an old steam piston. Here, you can get yourself all the games you like, from any genre you like and either free or purchasable.

There's very big differences in games regarding the power that's needed to run them, and some might be a little too much for your laptop. Ask your grandson to explain to you how to figure out how to tell if your laptop can run a game from the ""system requirements"" each of them comes with.

What you want to play is up to you! There's loads of categories to choose from, and you might want to explore those until you find something you like. Most games have a little trailer to show what they look like and how they work, and reviews next to them and underneath to help you choose.

Although it's not available on Steam, I can personally imagine that you might like Minecraft and have possibly heard of it before. You can roam a world full of animals, plants but also some vicious monsters completely free and build whatever you like, from a little house in the prairie to a tower to the sky!

Anyways, it's nice to hear that you are open for new things. Have fun!",6046

4305,"Why the FUCK are we still catering to billionaires and the ""elite"" class when we're on the cusp of a scorched earth and total societal collapse? The Titanic is sinking and we're serving cucumber sandwiches and playing Vivaldi to 1st class in front of the lifeboats we don't get to use, WHY is this OK","Seriously, what? Why? Why are we enabling the people who are fucking up the planet we all have to live on? Why do we serve them their meals and drive their cars and clean their laundry? I have a fantasy where every POS rich person who got what they got through human suffering and exploitation is just...ignored. 

Seriousky, try it. Pick your least favorite corrupt politician or out-of-touch space-fucking billionaire and play a scene in your mind where they wake up and no one acknowledges them.

Imagine their pissy little hissy fits when they demand their breakfast or clothes for the day or whatever only to be met by total silence and an indifferent, formerly-loyal workforce. Imagine their pathetic little scrunched up face getting redder and redder when they realize that they've lost it, it's gone...they can't coerce or bribe or threaten people to do their bidding anymore. They have to fucking cooperate if they want to live.

I know there will ALWAYS be indoctrinated dipshits who froam at the mouth in a frenzy to serve the predator class, but WHY? Why, after all the mounting evidence that billionaires and the ""elite"" are essentially parasites who make the world objectively worse through the working conditions they create and the environmental abuses they perpetuate, why do we KEEP WORKING TO MAKE THEIR LIVES COMFORTABLE WHILE THEY LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR OUR DEATHS?

The ultra-rich are acting like the global climate catastrophe doesn't matter to them, because it doesn't; their money will insulate them no matter how bad things get. Well, I fucking wish we could change that. Oh no, Jess Bezo's hydroponic farm in his secret New Zealand apocalypse island needs someone to maintain it? Get fucked Jeff, no self-sustaining food source unless you put the work in and do it yourself or else learn how to cooperate with the rest of humanity. 

Seriously, can we all just keep doing what we're doing and start working towards a healthier planet and society, while actively ignoring ultra-rich parasites in the process? We don't need a guillotine, all we need to do us stop serving these fucks until they realize what the ""we're in this together"" message their companies and governments propagate really means.

Whats the answer here? Why are we apparently more than okay to keep cleaning up after the shits who keep wrecking things for the rest of us? 

Oh and if you're here to defend billionaires because ""they help people by creating jobs"" or whatever fucking excuse you use to stand up for the people who would exploit you to death in a heartbeat, we are WELL past this argument. The ocean's on fire,  everything is dying, and the super-rich are still holding the match and gasoline; you piping in to say that maybe they have a good reason for doing what they're doing and we should let them play out their destruction is fucking stupid, delusional, and pathetic.

And by the way, a lot of people in the comments are quoting me to have said ""eat the rich"". I never said that. I said *ignore* and *stop inflating the egos of the rich* until they realize they need us more than we need them.  Because honesty, I like stuff. I enjoy convenience. *I'm fucking human.* I just don't see why we're allowing the ruling class to eschew sustainability so they can add another excessive amount of money on top of their already hugely excessive amount of money. What I'm advocating is for us to find more sustainable, non-disastrous ways to support quality of life, but the people who control that are apparently unwilling to change. So what do we do?

TL;DR: Why are we still enabling and glorifying our abusers?

Also - it doesn’t take 7 point blank shots to incapacitate or kill a man.

Regulations require us to review income and credit history to ensure loans we give out are likely to be paid back. Meanwhile you can rack up over $100k in student debt then end up working as a fry cook. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but the payments will be too much.

If the average American education is anything like mine, you won’t know a damn thing about finances and will have very little context for how you will pay off these loans when you are 18. You may as well give them the loans at 14 for how unprepared they will generally be. Recruiters and propaganda from the schools also push the idea that you have to go to college to be successful.

Edit: By have children I should clarify that I mean give birth, not raise children. I am very open to adoption and fostering kids. I would rather bring love to those who are already here than introduce new life.



Original Post:
I am hoping that wording makes sense. 

There are a few reasons I don’t want to have kids but the overarching one is that life is tough. I don’t feel like I should bring a new soul in the world to deal with all of the bullshit that previous generations have left behind. 

I understand the negativity of this perspective and I do not mean to discount the beauty of life. There are so many amazing things to experience. However, I am not convinced this is enough to bring new people into the world. I know we all experience life differently day to day so this may be my limited viewpoint, but curious if others share this thought process.




Edit 2: I have also been diagnosed with adenomyosis and have been told that I may have a high risk pregnancy if I were to try. I also held these feelings about giving birth long before my diagnosis. It is very possible learning this about myself helped solidify my personal feelings though too.

Edit 3: I am very aware of r/antinatalism and r/childfree now.

Edit 4: I find it odd people are saying I am “denying someone life”. There is no someone, I am not denying anyone anything, I am just not bringing someone into being. 

I am not claiming this is the worst time to exist on planet earth. Life has always been and will always be a challenge in unique ways depending on the time and place.

4334,"Are most men plagued with skid marks in their underwear, or am I just meeting unlucky/unhygienic people??","So I’m honestly just not sure at this point. I once lent some white basketball shorts to my dad when he wasn’t doing so great financially, and was living with me at my apartment. When I finally got them back after literal weeks (he’s the opposite of a punctual person) there were… um… well 💩 stains on the back area of them. Thoroughly grossed out, trying to be understanding, I proceeded to wash them 4 times, ended up under my bed folded up, stains still there, just to be washed again every now and then because I’m kinda afraid to wear them. 

At first, I thought this is something that was an odd ‘my dad thing’, until I got my hands on my boyfriend’s white, Naruto boxer briefs. They’re absolutely adorable but I felt pretty awkward when putting them in the wash, only to notice there were skid marks in his underwear too. 

I also remember seeing them in various places like visiting my brother and accidentally noticing his underwear thrown over the side of the hamper, as well as some bedrooms of guy friends’ of my boyfriend’s, when I’d be invited to go hang with them. 

This honestly, and completely undisrespectfully, troubles me. Idk about EVERYONE, but every woman I know wipes that bum over and over again until the paper is as bright as, well, paper, even if it takes 25 sheets… and my mom agrees. None of us have had that problem in our underwear since we were 6 at the very latest. 

So, my question is, are you guys just spending your entire lives wiping your bootyhole incorrectly and no one ever correcting you? Did your mothers not teach you how to do it right, or are y’all just slowly forgetting over the years?…because I honestly can’t think of any logical reason that I know this many people with skid marks in nearly every pair of underwear, and they’re all men. 

It seems silly, but it’s a legitimate question I just can’t get out of my head 😂😂😂

4337,Isn't shaming men for being virgins actually objectifying women in a way?,"I know that sounds weird but hear me out. I'm a man from a South Asian Muslim country. One of the things I've noticed from reddit is that men in Western society have immense pressure on them to lose their virginity. The word virgin is actually used as insult a lot of times. The go to insult is, "" He probably lives in his mom's basement and can't get laid"" lol. 

So basically my point is, when somebody shames men for being virgins, aren't they actually objectifying women? They are posing women as sexual objects that men must conquer in order to be deemed respectable members of the society and somehow not getting laid indicates something wrong with them. Doesn't this reduce women to mere sexual objects and intimacy with them a social currency? Could this be a reason that men respond aggressively to rejection and sometimes go down rabbit holes like inceldom? 
Why do some women indulge in virgin shaming then? Don't they say the cognitive dissonance here?
.




Edit: I am NOT saying women are the primary victims here. Men suffer the most in this. My only point is that some women who do this should stop this behavior because it indirectly hurts them. If they don't care about men , at least they should care about themselves and not objectify themselves like this.

Edit2: People are saying it just means they're undesirable to women. How does that make it better? Why should someone's worth be based off of the fact that women find them attractive or not?

  At least with ""socialist healthcare"" (they prefer to call it socialist rather than universal because obviously socialism=bad) everyone pays the same amount depending on what tax bracket they are in.

After a month of nothingness suddenly 12 (yes a dozen) identical convenience stores pop up. They look the same, they aim for the same floor plan, they sel the same products at the same prices.

The names are all tiny variations off of each other like <townname MART> or <Market of Townname> and all clearly bought their signs from the same place as the fonts, colors, size, and shapes are identical. These stores see no business that I've ever witnessed yet have large staff numbers and are surviving way longer than the former stores that closed on this street. 

When I enter one, they all stare at me while I shop. I don't usually get nervous but it feels like they're staring threateningly rather than intently.

They only accept cash unless you pay some $50. Most of their products are Walmart brand Great Value products being resold for higher prices.

Most of the products are expired food products. I bought bread from one without checking because I was in a rush, and it turned out it was two months expired!

Why not both??",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x33a12fcd0>,1645887493.0,"Couple of reasons:

First, giving other countries money has the benefit of keeping them from turning to Russia or China for support. Thus, it benefits the US because it's essentially buying allies and ensuring that foreign powers have trouble trying to expand their hegemonic influence. This is also why China invests so heavily in African infrastructure.

Second, countries having USD means they are likely to use USD. While a lot of global finance is based off the Dollar, China has been trying to use digital currencies and other practices to increase the amount of trade denominated in RMB. Just look to how Iran was cut off from SWIFT during the nuclear deal to see how controlling these institutions can turn into real international leverage.

Foreign aid is never really just about benevolence. Of course welfare isn't either. But the US is much better at justifying defence spending compared to actually fulfilling its social obligations to its own non-billionaire citizens.

Considering that reading the rules prior to posting is a requirement in just about every sub on this website, from now on any user that draws attention to the fact that they've not read our rules and engages in belittling an OP for asking a ""google-able"" question will receive a 3 day ban with a lovely reminder and link to our rules and sidebar. Belittling an OP because you think they have asked a question you deem dumb will also receive a 3 day ban.

We would like to also take this moment to remind you that this sub utilizes strikes against accounts, repeat offenders will be permanently banned.


No one among the mod team cares if the OP posts regularly on karma-farming subs, no one among the mod team makes assumptions regarding the circumstances a question has been asked. IF the question *appears genuine*, IF the OP is attempting to engage with people trying to educate / discuss with them, then this is the place for it. Google does not always generate discussion, and people looking up answers to things does not always lead them to a fully correct answer. Admittedly, there are many reasons why someone would not be capable of correctly googling something or leading themselves to the correct answer. Some people may just want to have a discussion.



 

**TL;DR** Regardless of the robust-ness of the question, you have **no right** in this sub to belittle someone for asking. We're coming down hard for it now. This serves as a sub-wide warning.

4355,Is the US really this bad?,"I'm a European and literally everything that I hear nowadays of the United States is very, very bad. I mean you have school shootings, an incompetent President, police brutality, nationalism, wealth inequality, shitty gun laws, warmongering politicians, an awful healthcare system that leaves you in debt, antivaxxers, not even to mention the horrible gesturing of the current pandemic.

I get it that the media usually portrays stuff like this in a much worse manner, but these problems seem to never stop and that's why I'm wondering, is there genuinely anything good happening?

One guy straight up “called bs”, they couldn’t believe I’ve never had this very specific American dish. Others kept recommending me American brands to try, that I “should be able to find in most supermarkets”. 

This is not the first time something like this has happened to me, there are entire groups dedicated to this. Americans will very often reply with “depends on the law in your state” or “you can get it at *American supermarket*”, “do you vote republican or Democrat” and similar. 

Why do people do this? I understand that American pop culture is very dominant, but straight up believing everyone else you’ll ever interact with on the World Wide Web is also from your country?



Edit: Thank you for some great answers. If I sounded passive aggressive or like I just wanted trash Americans, I’m sorry, that wasn’t my intend.

**EDIT 4: I didn’t expect this to blow up, so can’t reply to everyone - i’m not against stopping countries taking land. nor am I shit talking about Israel in particular. I’m against picking which innocent lives we save and which we don’t - and by we, I mean the western powers. You have Israel-Palestine, Saudi Arabia-Yemen, China-Uyghur etc**

**EDIT 5: The fact that this is getting ripped because of Israel, despite mentioning Saudi-Yemen, shows how many hypocrites are out there and why this world is as it is.**

So… based on recent events of Russia and Ukraine, why do we condemn Russians taking land but we’re okay with Israelis doing the same thing to the Palestinians?

Like.. is it because they don’t have resources to be of any use? If that’s the case, then Ukraine is a poor and corrupted country.

Or is it because it’s in our backyard?

4365,“The guy who murdered 8 people had a bad day”. What the F... is wrong with americans?,"Okay first of all some guy decides out of the blue that he wants to kill people. He doesn’t go to a specific place, he goes to THREE SEPARATE places and kills people in each one. 

Then when he gets caught part of the explanation given by the authorities for this act of disgusting violence is “he had a bad day”. Excuse me?! What the FUCK?! You know who had a bad day, EVERYONE at the places he shot. And you know who REALLY had a bad day, the 8 people who got killed and the 2 who got shot but survived and their families. 

I’m actually serious because that kind of mass shooting doesn’t happen anywhere else in the world, or at least not in a developed country. The mass shooting, the explanation. What the fuck?!?

Edit: I do realize this cop or that shooter don’t represent all of americans. My point was there are so many shootings happening in the USA. Even school children. Kids fight, hit each other, but murder?! Seriously, I think murder is kind of “just another Wednesday here” in the USA. Murdering a person is fucking horrific thing. I can’t even imagine the fear you experience when you’re doing something normal as just going to the mall or school and live through a shooting. This is not warzone where you expect to be shot at.

Edit 2: Some people have used the “he’s white so media and authorities try to defend him”. Which is another thing that’s put too much thought into. Who cares about his race or gender? I personally don’t give a fuck whether he was white, yellow, orange or blue. He IS a fucking psycho. 
My point was that on one hand mass shootings like this are not a rare occurrence in the USA. And on the other, the person who spoke to the media said something so incredibly stupid and honestly disrespectful. Imagine hearing that a loved one was shot because the murderer had a bad day. Just tell it how it is - a fucking psycho who had easy access to guns because of your laws went out on a shooting spree.

Edit 3: Just to answer collectively on a lot of comments that repeat each other. 

To the peeps who keep saying and repeating “we’re not all like that” - YES, we know. But a german saying “we’re not all like that” in 1942 wouldn’t make Germany look any better now, would it. 

To the people who understood me and tried to answer the question without feeling personally offended, because they can rationally think it through and realize that while not all americans are like that and they are definitely not like that, there is an actual problem in your country, thank you for your comment. 

To the people who use stats presenting that gun related deaths are around 30 000 people a year of which only about 2% are incident related - this guy killed 8 people, assume this happens every month for a year that’s 96 people, out of 30 000 that’s less than 1%. In numbers that might not sound bad, but a mass shooting every month is defently bad. (not implying that’s the case, just making a point about “only 2%”)

To the people who attacked me and my post based on my presumable race - what the fuck? 

To the grammar and perfectly correct people, yes, by “americans” I meant people from the USA, even though there’s North, South and Central America. My post was about an event that happened in the USA where people are also “american” so I thought that was clear.  Sorry for your confusion.

Final Edit: To the people saying I live in “privilege” outside of the USA and they have to live through this daily - what kind of fucked up brainwash minds do you have to think that NOT living in fear OF GETTING SHOT AT is a PRIVILEGE?!? Do you see what I mean when I ask what is wrong with you? You’ve lived through so much gun related violence you think people not living in it are privileged. No they’re not, it’s how basic life should be. You had a fucking riot and stormed the capitol because some of you (not a small number) didn’t agree with the results of the vote for president, but mass shootings - “we just live in it daily, you privileged asshole”. 

I live in a fucked up Eastern European country where we don’t have the best education, we don’t have much opportunity for success, the quality of life is low - but yes I live in privilege, good god. 

And to the people who say mass shootings happen everywhere all the time but we don’t hear about it because media has USA as the center of the world - No. In Europe (and I assume the rest of the world) we barely have covered any news since your president election and riots. And most if not all american news coverage is politically related. 

I got some genuine answers for which I thank you, and I think many people realized how the USA is viewed from the outside world which was shocking to them. 

I know not all of you are like that, and I know there are genuine normal people who think exactly like me about those topics and would like a change. You’re the people who make others believe in the so called “American dream” - it’s not all bad and it’s not all of you, but regardless, there are some big fat fucked up problems you got there.

Like Abortion, gun control, diversity, the economy or healthcare. They tend to vote for the party they think fits them best on one or two policies. They might not agree on the others but value their one or two reasons more then them.

The easiest one to see for this is probably abortion. Plenty of people that are ProLife don't give a shit about Trickle down or supply side economics. They might pick up those beliefs because pro life candidates do and they trust their opinion. But the main reason they vote Republican is they value life at conception and any vote for a democrat threatens that in their eyes.

You can do the same for the democratic party. Plenty of people support it's push for more accessible healthcare but don't like gun control proposals. Other might be pro-life but not as focused on that as they are economic reforms. Basically the average citizen picks key issues and either compromises, explains away, or adopts the other stances of the party that supports them.

Edit: In a vain attempt to cut down on that amount of similar replies I'm getting on this I'm going to share some common responses.

This has been described as single issue voting. Meaning people who only vote based on a single issue. I think that can boil down most what I'm saying. I think most people do make decisions on a few issues and then just agree to the rest. Someone pointed this out as Wedge Issues which I think is a wonderful term everyone should learn about.

However, this is just based on the people I talk to in the Midwest. Friends and Family, college educated and HS drop outs, retired and just entering the workforce, living comfortably and those below the poverty line. Completely personal experience and I'm by no means a political expert nor have a studied the hard stats.

I don't think this is the only reason people vote for Trump. He has a cult following and a big enough base. I think it does answer part of OPs question.

Side note:
I'm not advocating for Pro-Life. I'm sorry you got such an anti Pro-Life boner you need to say something about how stupid it is anytime someone brings it up. I get it, it's stupid the government feels like it needs to regulate the issue. I get that term Pro-Life is hypocritical since after the baby is born most Pro-lifers don't give a fuck about it. I do understand that Roe v. Wade can't be overturned and it's mostly up to States how to handle that. However that doesn't stop a federal government from having a certain amount of over reach. A Republican controlled federal government isn't going to step in to stop a State from saying you can only get an abortion in the first two weeks of pregnancy. They are also going to elect judges to the Supreme Court that if this issue comes up they will ignore the entire point of Roe V Wade.

I brought the issue up because it's a good example of people choosing party on single or a small amount issues on their platform. I didn't bring it up because I wanted to see everyone's hot take.",7764
4374,Do Americans realise you can have social healthcare AND private healthcare simultaneously?,"Edit: There seems to be some confusion and a fair bit of anger here. What I'm asking is this: Why do Americans claim living in countries with social healthcare is bad because they prefer private care, when in fact countries with social healthcare DO have the option of private care? 


Whenever the healthcare debate comes up, I often see Americans arguing they wouldn't want to live in a country with socialised healthcare because they'd have to wait for treatment or get sub-par public care. 


Are they aware that we also have the option of private healthcare? It seems to be a point that is completely ignored.


I live in New Zealand. If something happens and I need healthcare, I can ALWAYS get it, regardless of how much money I have. Can't afford birth control? No problem, here's the pill for free. Can't afford to take time off work for cancer treatment? No problem, here's 80% of your wages to cover you until you get better, and we'll pay for all your chemo. Need an MRI? No problem, there's a bit of a waiting list but we'll prioritise those who need it most and continue working with you in the meantime.


Don't want to wait for your MRI? Don't want to go to Family Planning for free birth control? No problem! You can get private health insurance!


I pay $17 per month for extensive healthcare coverage, including all surgeries, rehabilitation, diagnostics, funeral costs and pallative care. I also have full cancer care with an immediate cash payout of $50k NZD.


If I don't want to wait for public healthcare, that's fine - I just call my insurance provider and say ""Hey, can you pay for this treatment please?"" and they'll send me to a private healthcare provider.


So what happens if I lose my job and can't afford insurance any more? No worries! Private healthcare will always have my back. I will never worry about how I'm going to afford my medication. I will never panic trying to decide between paying for food for the week or paying for an ambulance (also ambulances in my city are free - the rest of the country is pretty cheap). 


Public healthcare does NOT remove choice. It gives choices to those who didnt have them before. It gives EVERYONE the chance to get healthcare, whether it's expensive, fancy healthcare or just your local community hospital.

If they are trying to change genders because of the social norms around that gender, and they don’t feel as if they can be the feminine male or a masculine female, aren’t they just enforcing those stereotypes that men/women are a certain way?

For them freedom means that no one tells them what to do, except for those things that they agree with anyway or that don't affect normal daily life. While for us freedom is more the feeling of safety from guidelines, rules and support within the society.

Therefore, while we consider it freedom to not have to worry about health costs, they would feel unfree if they were forced to have an insurance. We feel free knowing that there are no guns around us, while they feel free being able to have guns.

It’s not okay to force acceptance of a circumstance that is unhealthy, in my mind. It should not be conflated that being against obesity is to be against the person who is obese, as there are those with medical/mental conditions of course.

This isn’t about making those who are obese feel bad. This is about more and more obese people on social media and in life generally being vocal about pushing the idea that being obese is totally fine. Pushing the idea that there are no health consequences to being obese and hiding behind the positivity movement against any criticism as such.

Austria has more inhabitants than Louisiana, New Jersey or Washington, but way less total deaths (150 vs 500), way less deaths per day (12 vs 100) and a much slower doubling rate.

Our government took this crisis seriously and stepped in to prevent deaths and unemployment. The American government downplayed the crisis and didn't do anything for weeks.

Now you guys will be facing a 9/11 per day and yet I still see lots of people cheering from Trump and talking about how liberals are only fear mongering or that the cure will be worse than the problem itself.

But... has anyone else sort of had the opposite experience?

I'm not talking like your sibling was so toxic that you had to cut them off, because that would be a different situation, but does anyone else just sort of have a really ""meh"" bond with their sibling? Like with my sister, even after many years, I just don't really know her that well and even though she's family, she just feels kind of like a stranger. And it's not because she's a bad person or either of us dislike each other, we just find it kind of boring to be around the other. When we were kids we would fight a lot, I think possibly even more than the average siblings, and since we never really had a real bond, when she moved away it just kind of completely fizzled. She feels like an acquaintance at best that I can have lukewarm small talk with.

I'm fine with that, I'm perfectly fine with just calling on birthdays and having 5 minute conversations with her, but I was wondering, is it the same with anyone else? You never really found your sibling to be your best friend or your worst enemy, they were just sort of... there? I feel like I can't really ask this question in real life, because everyone always expects everyone to have either a wonderful or absolutely horrible relationship with their family. And whenever I've said it out loud, people always sort of look down on me for not being super super close to my sibling.

But I really want to know, since I never see it shown online or in TV shows, does anyone else have the same experience? It's just sort of a ""meh"" bond with your sibling?

I feel bad for him because my penis is extremely large and very satisfying to women and definitely works perfectly all the time, so I wanted to help him answer this question. He says that if he's at least a little above the threshold it might make him feel better.

Also, who is the piece of shit Doctor that coined the term ""micro-penis"" and why is it even considered a medical issue? Under what circumstances would a doctor even diagnose this issue? What does that conversation sound like? Is the doctor held responsible when the patient immediately jumps out of the nearest window upon receiving this diagnosis? These are all things my friend is curious about.

4422,Is being transgender a mental illness?,"I’m not transphobic, I’ve got trans friends (who struggle with depression). Regardless of your stance on pronouns and all that, it seems like gender dysphoria is a pathology that a healthy person is not supposed to have. They have a much higher rate of suicide, even after transitioning, so it clearly seems like a bad thing for the trans person to experience. When a small group of people has a psychological outlook that harms them and brings them to suicide, it should be considered a mental illness right? 

This is totally different than say homosexuality where a substantial amount of people have a psychological outlook that isn’t harmful and they thrive in societies that accept them. Gender dysphoria seems more like anorexia or schizophrenia where their outlook doesn’t line up with reality (being a male that thinks they’re a female) and they suffer immensely from it. Also, isn’t it true that transgender people often suffer from other mental illnesses? Do trans people normally get therapy from psychologists? 


Edit: Best comment

>Transgenderism isn't a mental illness, it's a cure to a mental illness called gender dysphoria. Myself and many other trangenders believe it's caused by a male brain developing first and then a female body developing later or vice versa. Most attribute it to severe hormone production changes while the child is in the womb. Of course, this is all speculation and we don't know what exactly causes gender dysphoria, all we know is that it's a mental illness and that transgenderism is the only cure. Of course gender dysphoria can never be fully terminated in a trans person, only brought down to the point where it doesn't cause much of a threat for possible depression or anxiety, which may lead to suicide. This is where transitioning comes in. Of course there will always be people who don't want to admit there's anything ""wrong"" with trans people, but the fact still stands that gender dysphoria is a mental illness. For most people, they have to go to a gender therapist to get prescribed hormones or any sort of medical transition methods but because people don't like admitting there's something wrong with transgenders, some areas don't even require that legally.

Research right now suggests that it's based on the shape of the brain, so it's more of an anomaly than an illness. 

I've also seen a few articles floating around r/ftm (I'm trans and hang out on there a bit) saying there is a good chunk of autistic trans folks, so there might be some kind of a link there as well. Since Autism is developmental, it suggests being trans is developmental as well. 

Personally, viewing it as a mental disorder helped me cope. I couldn't understand my feelings and hated myself for them, and calling it a disorder is the only thing that brought some comfort.  Something about knowing it was out of my hands just made it easier on me  However, a lot of trans people get offended at it being called a disorder / illness, so I wouldnt go around saying it is one, regardless of your position on the issue.

It was a question based on swarms of Instagram posts which flared up after the BLM riots in America and then basically died away as soon as it wasn't ""cool"" any more (which I find offensive in itself), and my black colleague saying it was pretty fucking condescending - in his words, ""patting the n- on the head and saying look at what a good job n- over there is doing"". The way he would emphasise the skin colour when talking about it just made me think that that's part of the problem, because I think judging anyone or treating anyone differently by the colour of their skin in any way is wrong, whether you think it's positive or not.

I have never seen or read anything as graphic as the themes in the bible. 

At one point 2 girls intoxicate their father in a cave and (it's even uncomfortable for me to type this out lol) have him impregnate them both. That's as nicely as I can put it.

One of Isaac's son had his twin brother dying of hunger at his feet pleading him to feed him, and the brother straight up told him to give him his birthright or he would not help him, then took his father's blessing by lying to him making his brother want to kill him.

4444,Could married people not having sex be correlated to the fact middle-aged men do not take care of themselves?,"I don't mean to piss off anyone. Also, I'm a straight dude.

I've seen so many married men on Reddit and the Internet in general complaining that their sex lives are dead and their wives don't want to have sex with them.

In all honesty, I've generally noticed that most middle-aged men make little to no effort to keep themselves attractive or in good shape. Heck, just take a walk through the mall. You'll notice that most middle-aged men usually have a large pot belly, are dressed badly,  ~~balding~~, etc. 

Based on personal experiences and observations, women in general are mostly skinnier and noticeablely in more effort to keep their appearances up. Even as they get older

It seems highly likely that since most middle-aged married men don't put in the effort to look attractive, it's probably the reason why they are not having an active sex life

Edit: balding is hereditary. You learn something new every day

Edit2: for those asking, i had thought balding was a direct consequence of not eating healthily, exercising and stress",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x3441e9bd0>,1642084787.0,"I'm not going to say that isn't part of it, but it also has to do with a lot more. 

Odds are, people who complain like that, don't see the underlying issues. Yes, maybe them being overweight doesn't *help*, but there's also bigger issues at play. Do they listen to their wives, do they show affection and love the  way the wife wants (i.e. love language). Do they do things to make themselves look attractive beyond the physical? People find people attractive when they're kind or helpful, funny, intelligent, etc. If all you do is drink beer, slap her ass, and watch sports, that's not going to turn her on even if you're physically attractive and fit.

Edit: I should add that this goes both ways obviously. OP was questioning men's complaints so I only answered about men. 

Men want women to show them love and affection too.

4449,Why is it bad to say trans women aren't the same as biological women?,"I watched a video about JK Rowling today, and the person in the video said that JK Rowling's tweets were very harmful and were making life dangerous for trans people.
  
As far as I know, JK Rowling has taken the stance that trans women, while still women, are not the same as people who were born as women (I hope that's the right way to say that). But isn't that true? At a biological level they are different, that's just a fact.

Sorta. Let me explain. Trans people know perfectly fucking well what their biology is and that it's not identical to their cis counterparts.   That is **separate** from their gender. It is seen as bad because that ""biologically"" line is often dogmatically used by transphobes to *inextricably tie gender and sex together.*

It's also treated negatively because it's more or less a transphobic dogwhistle. Again, because biologically speaking the majority of trans people know their gender doesn't align with their sex, bringing up the ""biology"" side put trans people in a tricky position and effectively ""forces"" them to concede to that point. However the issue there is that to the majority of transphobes that is all they need to invalidate yours and everyone's identity.

This leaves trans people and their allies to avoid engaging in those conversations at all, outside of people they are comfortable with, because it is often just a trap used against them. Trans people know their bodies better than others do and they understand what issues they face as a result of those bodies. It also doesn't help that this whole ""biology argument"" is usually just a gateway to peddle more dangerous transphobic ideas or push laws meant to discriminate against trans people.",5940
4450,For those who do not want the COVID vaccine - Would you accept a card giving you access to all facilities as the vaccinated if that card also was an attestation that you would not seek professional medical care if you become ill with COVID?,"The title kind of says it  all, but.

Right now certain facilities require proof of vaccination.   Would those who refuse the vaccine agree to be registered as ""refusing the vaccine"" if that meant they had the same access and privileges to locations and events as the vaccinated, if in exchange they agreed that they would not seek (and could be refused) professional medical services if they become ill with COVID-19?

**UPDATE:  Thank you all who participated.  A few things:**

This was never a suggestion on policy or legislation.  It was a question for the unvaccinated.  My goal was to get more insight into their decision and the motivations behind it.  In particular, I was trying to understand if most of them had done reflection on their decisions and had a strong mental and moral conviction to their decision.  Likewise, I was curious to see how many had made the decision on purely emotional grounds and had not really explored their own motivation.

For those who answered yes - I may not agree with your reasoning but I do respect that you have put the thought into your decision and have agreed (theoretically) to accept consequences for your decision.

For those who immediately went to whatabout-ism (obesity, alcohol, smoking, etc) - I am assuming your choice is on the emotional spectrum and honest discourse on your resolve is uncomfortable.  I understand how emotions can drive some people, so it is good to understand just how many fall under this classification.

It would have been nice if there had been an opportunity for more discussion on the actual question.  I think there is much to be gained by understanding where those who make different decisions are coming from and the goal of the question was to present a hypothetical designed to trigger reflection.

As an ex-journalist, I had to deal with a lot of cops, and I found a lot of them, especially in small communities, to be fundamentally decent. However, the way that I kind of ended up was that though there are good individuals within the institution, as a whole, the institution is fundamentally flawed. In the way that it trains its people, in the way that it views violence, in a way that it views the communities it ostensibly protects.

That, and simple tribalism means that people who are, individually, good people, can still circle the wagons around harmful people who corrupt the institution as a whole.

One bad apple spoils the whole bunch, as it were. And in an institution that we place trust in to arbitrate justice and decide in some cases who lives and who dies, we must demand reach the highest possible standards.

In response to common questions: 

• Yes, of course race and other minority statuses, as well as socioeconomic status, have to do with this. I am autistic and while that is mostly invisible, it still means I have to suppress a lot of natural behaviors and tendencies. Autistic people are often [harassed and/or abused by cops too](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-016-2958-3), and if I weren't white, my interactions with police would be even more frightening than they already are.

• Yes of course not all small-town police are good, and small towns can foster deep-rooted corruption. I'd argue it's even easier for it to take root than in large cities, and once it's in, it's hard to get out. One commenter talking about their experiences at BLM protests in different cities and how the police responded sums it up very well, and I can attest to similar experiences at BLM protests in one of the communities I covered. 

• By ""Circling the wagons,"" I am primarily referring to police unions and their habit of protecting bad actors and attempting to force people out for naming police who do harm others. 

• If you are commenting to tell me journalism bad, you're hilarious. You should take your routine to the comedy club. Please ask yourself why your favored politicians want you to not believe the people presenting evidence they are lying to you.

4465,"Is it normal to feel caught between not trusting the government/mainstream media, but also thinking most conspiracy theories are ridiculous?","This is something that's been frustrating me for a while. It feels like there is no sensible middle ground, and you are actively pushed towards becoming more extreme and crazy in your beliefs if you try and question anything.

I think most people would agree that governments and the wealthy elite/corporations do an awful lot of shady shit. It seems like almost every day there is a new story about corruption, exploitation, etc. Rich people seem to basically treat the law as optional and never get challenged for that. Billionaires exploit workers and manipulate the stock market with the help of their friends in government in order to reap in vast wealth. The Panama Papers, the Epstein/Weinstein scandals, insider trading around the coronavirus; the list goes on and on and on, and this is probably just the tip of the iceburg as these are only the incidents we know about that have been made public. You could talk about this stuff for hours, but my point is, there are clearly many examples of businesses/governments/powerful people colluding to make money at the expense of others, and cover up their crimes; some very large and insidious in nature. And most of the organisations that report on these things are owned by those very same people, so it's hard to believe you will ever get completely honest, unbiased information from them. When faced with this, it seems only natural that people would want to question the 'official' narrative and try and do some research of their own.

But the problem is, as soon as you do that, you almost immediately run into the opposite extreme. 5G causing coronavius, Bill Gates trying to depopulate the Earth through mandatory vaccinations, satanic peodfile rings, lizard people, flat Earth/hollow Earth, etc. Again, the list goes on and on. There are so many utterly ridiculous theories out there that all seem to link in with each other, creating this vast, fictional conspiracy narrative where every single incident that ever occurs has some deep, hidden meaning or ulterior motive. And almost all of it is based on pseudoscience, misrepresentation of the facts, or outright lies. Believing this stuff would be just as stupid, if not more so, than blindly believing every piece of propaganda governments put out.

I'm getting so tired of finding something, be it a YouTube video or an article, that seems to provide an interesting alternate take on some world event, and then half-way though they'll be like 'and of course, as we know, the Jewish elites who control the Illuminati have been using vaccines to turn people homosexual in an attempt to destroy Western culture'. Instantly, all credibility is ruined, and it makes you question if even the more sensible, reasonable stuff they said had any basis in reality. And god forbid you ever try and read the comments on any of these pieces of media. It's mostly people quoting Bible scripture, ranting about satanic influences, or people describing some weird spiritual nonsense about how our souls are being harvested by evil inter-dimensional being who want to force us to reincarnate or some other crap. That's another note: it's also depressing how spirituality seems to have been co-opted by these nutjobs.

This has turned into a bit of a rant, sorry.

**TL;DR** Is it normal to feel like your only options are 1) Believe everything the government/news tells you, perhaps putting up some token resistance, but never actually letting your views stray too far out of their comfort zone? or 2) Subscribe to a prepostorous web of consipracy theories that basically demand you rewrite your entire perception of reality and ignore every fact you've ever been told?",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x346bbe350>,1588596328.0,"Welcome to independent thought, it gets worse from here on.

Jokes aside, if you come up with a good way to find trustworthy news tell the rest of us. Until then you are stuck doing what the rest of us does: Trying to consume a wide array of media, keep the bias' behind them in mind, and try to extrapolate what is actually going on from there.

Otherwise try to find independent organisations and stay as close as possible to the source of the information (e.g. scientist quite often actually try to give laymans explanations these days - which are often more interesting and more informative than the abstract that filters down into mainstream media).

On the practical side, it quite simply comes down to finding sources who you reasonably trust or whose bias you are at least aware of.

Personally I found the work of the so called ""Skeptics"" movement - a social movement dedicated to the promotion of science - quite valuable. Though at the edges of the movement there tends to be a good bit of scientism and elitism.

And to preserve your sanity, start collecting some guiding issues. We all can't know about everything, but beeing properly informed about a few important issues can often reveal a pattern in how information that is presented to you, is manipulated.

&#x200B;

Lastly, quite a lot of the shady stuff that governments and politicians get up to isn't even hidden, they just trust that the public memory is short enough that it doesn't matter what they do.

We have literally created an arsenal of weapons capable of destroying our own entire species several times over??? What braindead animal would ever do that?

The worst part is how we've assured that any small scale attack will inevitably lead into all out war. It's one strike and we're all out. Do we expect NONE of the estimated 13,000 bombs to EVER be used? Not a SINGLE ONE? Is the fate of humanity hinging on this absurd expectation? Why is there research still being put into developing STRONGER and even MORE devastating weapons if they're expected to never be used? Are regular nukes from decades ago not a good enough ""deterrent""?

The past couple of years have completely erased the last shred of hope I had for humanity and I don't know what to do anymore.

I still agree with the post and am excited to read other people's thoughts!

**Edit** 2: It seems the answer is a combination of factors, like:


1) People's thoughts not changing on the matter (some think he was erratic and fighting back and some have a line drawn in the sand saying he should not have died, period. I agree with both and think he'd be alive if he reacted calmly, but it's no excuse for him to die, and being calm should not be a prerequisite to live, especially since being arrested is probably quite frightening.

2) The BLM movement is slowing down, possibly due to covid lasting much longer than it should have.

3) The movement has gone beyond George Floyd and encompasses much more than one person or even one race. Floyd was the spark that ignited the explosion.

4471,Why do we always boost teenage girls self esteem but never do the same for teenage boys?,"Now this is a double standard I truly don't understand. Like most others I can see some logic behind them, or at least the viewpoint of others who enforce it. Not saying I agree with them, but I understand why.

This one though, I truly do not understand. There have been countless studies showing no real correlation between gender and body image as a teenager. Even things like steroid use and eating disorders are as common in young boys as young girls. We all know teenage boys get bullied for how they look, not being tall enough, not being buff enough, being ugly, etc. . It's not something uncommon and probably something we've seen in real like a lot.

And yet, I never see anyone really discussing helping teenage boys with self esteem. It's even shown that most schools don't even know how to deal with their problems, only being taught about the issues girls face. I even remember being a teen, I was always taught to boost women's self esteem, but I was never taught to do the same for guys. In fact, there are many who are shocked at how insecure boys can be, and it baffles me why.

So, why do we not try and boost self esteem for boys like we do for girls?

PS: this isn't some MRA or MGTOW stuff coming out of my mouth. Please don't discredit the question because you think it is.

Edit: I didn't think it would blow up to this level but I want to make one thing clear, I do not want this to become an MRA vs Feminazi debate. I don't want any people saying things like ""they want men to bow down to women"" or ""well men rape women so it's to prevent that"" kind of stuff. Try and keep the political discourse civil. It is not an us vs them, its an all of us vs the problem.

Edit 2: I can not take ""toxic masculinity"" posts serious because of what I heard at a seminar discussing it.

a) They weren't as off as pundits portrayed, a lot of people just can't read polls.

In reality it means in 10 coin flips, she wins 6 of them but loses 4 of them, on average.

b) they've since attempted to correct for the issue (the main issue was they weren't correcting for education)

4481,How do I not let myself slip into inceldom?,"I(21M) find myself flipping back and forth between trying to be an ally to women and believing in TRP or BP stuff.

I often feel frustrated and bitter towards women a lot because of my failures in dating. I’ve never had a girl like me and I’m still a virgin at 21 both of these make me feel awful about myself. I wouldn’t say that I hate women on the level of other incels, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t often feel resentment.

I find myself wondering why I can’t just be a chad and why women are so shallow when I know that’s not exactly rational. I have really shitty self esteem, and have been shown and in some cases have sought out incel beliefs. I’ve looked through incel forums since I was 14.

I feel like I constantly see confirmation of things about women I’ve read online through the girls around me. Specifically in my close female friends and female bullies.

I really don’t want to be an incel but I feel myself sliding on a slippery slope to that.

How do I not be one?",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x34873dc10>,1654205309.0," No one has said this, but it's honestly very brave of you to post this and very self aware of you to recognize harmful tendencies toward a dangerous ideology.  You're already on the path to getting out of that stuff by asking for help and advice. 

It's easy to get caught up in what other people think of you.  Rejection is tough, too.  I wouldn't recommend dating when your self-esteem is low - you'll attract the wrong kind of people and healthy people may be concerned about dating someone who has major insecurities. 

 Ultimately, you'll want your self worth to come from within.  Women are often attracted to confidence. 

You're the only you in the universe. You have incredible value as a human.  Don't be a slave to the dating game that says either you win big or you're a loser.  It's not true. 

Enjoy this precious gift of life - focus on the things that bring you joy, hanging out with friends, a new hobby.  Read about how to be more mentally healthy, get a therapist, invest in yourself.  Learn what it means to be a good person, volunteer to help others (perhaps you can volunteer to help elderly people or even victims of domestic violence).  

Some women, especially those who feel they have powerful advantages in dating, can be bitches because they get away with it.  They're insecure and they feel powerful being able to reject tons of guys. Don't play their game, avoid them.  It's important to remember that your bad experiences with particular women don't translate to the entire gender - not all women are bad, but not all of them are good too.  However as a whole, they can suffer disadvantages like domestic abuse, pay differences, etc. 

I guess what i mean is, you can be an ally for women in general to have equality, and you can still hold women accountable to have decent human behavior.   Deciding to not to pursue a relationship with you does not make a woman a bad person, but rejecting you in a callous disrespectful manner does.  Are you mad because you got rejected and that affects your self worth or are you mad because of how you got rejected?  Even the most beautiful, handsome talented people in the world have relationship troubles- you're not alone! 

Don't waste your time, your life, trying to obtain approval and acceptance at all costs.  Once you feel secure in your worth as a decent person, you'll attract the right kind of person. 

Maybe make friends with some positive older male role models and if you feel comfortable, share your concerns.  I think people often get into these rabbit holes and bad ideology when they are lonely and isolated.  Friendship is much safer than dating for your self-esteem.  If you are a good friend - loyal, reliable, interesting, thoughtful - you will be a good boyfriend to someone.  Work on being a good friend and having healthy boundaries. 

Best of luck and cheer up - lots of women feel rejected in the dating game as well, it's just online dating that is really skewed and can be toxic.",10656

EDIT: Wow this blew up, thanks for upvoting and continuing the discussion. I would like to point a few things I learned from living in a different country for three years and traveling a bit, since leaving the country was a thing people are saying. 

- When you live in a different country you are now a foreigner. There's a lot of things that come with being a foreigner, especially if you don't look like the people of that country. 

- Some countries have almost no diversity, I'm talking 95% one race or more. This effects how people think and how the government thinks.

- We are allowed to critique, disagree, and change the government. It's not always easy but we can do it. 

My entire life I have felt a constant mix of disgust, outrage, and fear in the US. When I lived abroad, I realized I was undeniably from the US, that there were things I liked about it, and things I missed. I care about US issues and I want to fight and make things better for me, people like me, and everyone in this country. This is the country I was born in and I don't want to give up and abandon it. The US has rampant corruption, racism, classism, healthcare issues, and more.

But I still have hope. I have hope because throughout the entire history of this country people who look like me have been enslaved, murdered, and people have tried their best to erase us. But we're still here, we're always going to be here, and we get better with every year. I want everyone to get better with each year. I don't know how long it's going to take and exactly everything it's going to take to make the changes I want. But I truly believe that we can get to a better place and that we are getting better slowly. 

We shouldn't runaway from corruption and injustice. We have to stand up to it. If people refuse to care then we have to be the ones to care. If they are corrupt them we must become incorruptable.",4304

4487,"When a black man called me a sl*t, a ho, etc, why did it only get mild reactions from the people around us but they blew up when I called him the N word in response?","27F. Today I got into a bit of an altercation at the grocery store. A man wouldn't leave me alone and kept trying to flirt with me, despite me completely ignoring him he followed me around and eventually started making ruder and ruder comments. He took some vegetables out of my trolley and I eventually snapped at him to please leave me alone.

That was when he really got riled up. He asked what I was looking so good for if I couldn't handle attention, asked why I was wearing so much makeup, asked if I enjoyed looking like a slut and being a tease. At that point people started looking at us, but nobody said anything. Not the women, not the men, not the store employees (two teenagers).

He continued to level abuse at me, calling me a slut, a ho, a tease, a bitch.

Besides the rough past few days I've been having, his behaviour and everyone else's passiveness enraged me. My blood was boiling and I couldn't control myself, all I wanted to do was to hurt him. So I said to him, ""Shut the fuck up, n****r.""

Suddenly, at that point, there were some LOUD protests from the people watching. Some people gasped and others just went like ""oh hell no"" and ""what did you just say?"" and just a lot of comments like that. I immediately wondered, where was this energy when this man was following me around, harassing me, and then publicly verbally abusing me with very misogynistic comments?

I just threw the bag of onions at him and left the store and cried in my car for about 15 minutes. I don't think anyone was recording, so I'm not too worried about being the subject of a witch hunt.

But that is my question, basically. Why was everyone so fine with how he was acting towards me? And I know what I did in response was fucked up and unpardonable too, but why did they think it was that much worse?

I in no way condone this behavior, but to simply answer the question it comes down to moral cowardice and groupthink. He probably was intimidating to more than just you, so folks rationalize minding their business over being proactive in their approach to call out abuse taking place in front of them. Then when you lobbied the word back at him it was probably a domino effect of one person said something then 3, until you lost the crowd. Unfortunately, they probably felt ashamed for not helping you, so it made it easier for them to condemn you because in their minds they already disregarded you. 

I'm sorry you had this experience it seems like there was compounded issues on top of one another that is a lot of pressure. I don't think you calling him the N word means you're judging our whole race however I'm glad you acknowledge that it was wrong and shouldn't have been said.

And suddenly, the teacher gasped and exclaimed my name, the whole class went quiet and everyone looked at me like I was some kind of rapist. I still cringe every time to this day.

4495,"17 year old unvaxxed, wanting to get vaccinated but parents are extremely against it. Should I take it behind their backs?","I’m 17 years old and in my province (from canada) I am legally allowed to get the vaccine without parental confirmation. I’ve been thinking of getting it behind their backs for a while even without the newly introduced vaccine passport, which has been another motivating factor me.

This passport restricts many activities such as, going to the gym (a big part of my life rn), restaraunts etc. Those of you who consistently hit the gym can understand how hard it’d be to go without it. All my friends also currently have it and it’s made me feel isolated as I haven’t been able to partake in certain activities with them

I’m worried about the repercussions I would go through if my parents would find out I took it since they are heavily against it. They have been constantly telling me different theories trying to drill an idea into my head that the vaccine is bad, though I know it isn’t the case. I don’t want to disappoint them or make them upset at the same time either because I still love my parents.

4496,"Why is America's healthcare so bad, and why do Americans not prioritize reforming it?","Constantly on Reddit threads, I see posts about how a trip to the hospital cost $1000+, or a birth of a child cost $7000+. It's absolutely disgusting. Even people with ""good"" level insurance pay out thousands of dollars on routine/simple procedures.

In the UK, and we have the NHS (national health service). It's by no means perfect - there are plenty of delays, and it's constantly understaffed, but at least I know if I break a leg and go to the hospital, I won't get a bill which will make me homeless. And all its costs me is about £200 a month national insurance (on my current wage).

Why can't America implement something like this?

Moreover, and this is the most mind boggling bit, why is it that Americans aren't basing their voting purely on healthcare as a priority? Literally, if you get diagnosed with cancer, that's your home and life gone in your current system. Your health should be your absolute first priority - everything else is secondary.

Edit: just wanted to say thanks for all the comments. I can see a lot of Americans do in fact give a massive shit about the disgusting healthcare.

Edit continued: also, major fucking applause for the people PMing me saying the healthcare isn't actually that bad, and it's just left wing media bringing it up. Dude. Literally people in this thread saying how shit it is. Get some perspective

EDIT2: I'm reading through all replies, and responding to some. A lot of people who are against free public healthcare is basing it on your taxes rising. 

First of all, IF your taxes rise, understand it'll replace your premium, and ALL deductibles if you get into a medical emergency and need to go to the hospital.

Secondly, a rise a tax SHOULD be circumvented as much as possible by increasing tax on the super rich, and heavily decreasing military spending (which is also, quite frankly, on absurd levels).

Thirdly, even if your tax rises, you are safe with the knowledge that if you, your sister, your mother, your friend, your neighbour, the man down the road who can't afford insurance, any of them get diagnosed with cancer or are hit by a car and get taken to hospital, they are completely covered.

4498,Is it fair to assume most religious people (in the U.S. at least) are usually only religious because they were raised into it and don’t put too much serious thought into their beliefs?,"It just feels like religion is more of a cultural thing, like something you’re raised in. I remember being in middle school/high school and asking my friends about religion (not in a mean way, just because I was curious about it) and they really couldn’t tell me much, they even said they don’t really know why they’re what religion they are, just that they are.

I feel like you can’t seriously believe in the Abrahamic religions in the year 2021 without some reservation. I feel like the most common kinds of people that are religious are either 

__A) depressed or mentally hindered individuals who need the comfort of religion to function and feel good in their life (people that have been through trauma or what have you)__

__B) people who were raised into it from a young age and don’t really know any better (probably the most common)__

__C) people who fear death and the concept of not existing forever, (similar to A. people but these people aren’t necessarily depressed or sad or anything.)__

Often all three can overlap in one person.

It’s just.. I’m sorry if this sounds disrespectful but I can’t see how anyone could seriously believe in Christianity, Islam, Mormonism, etc. in the current time period outside of being one of the people mentioned above. There are just way too many problems and contradictions. To the people that do believe, I feel like they really don’t take the time to sit down and question things, I feel like they either ignore the weak parts of their religion, or use mental gymnastics to get around them. I just want to know if I’m pretty much right in this belief of mine or if I’m just an asshole who doesn’t know what I’m talking about.",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x34bb56d90>,1621478760.0,"In Sweden over 75% of the population consider themselves atheists, but ⅔ of those are still members of the church.

4499,Does anyone else feel more and more alone the deeper they progress into adulthood?,"Like it’s really odd to me. I remember growing up thinking I would just have people in my life. People at the finish line of life achievements to pat you on the back. Or having good friends in your workplace; a close tight knit group of people. Like shouldn’t adult life be like an episode of friends or something? Or at least leaning toward something like that? It seems like the more I grow older the more the importance on relationships fades. Like I keep asking myself in my daily life: “where are all the people?”. Even though I live in a big city with thousands of people rushing by me everyday. Seems like everyone around me prods me to focus on getting a good job and being stable. But in some of the most isolated moments of my life it really occurred to me. What does anything mean if there is no one there to talk/see/hear about it? So what you landed a great job. What if no one batted an eye to it. Just get on with it? I dunno. I honestly wish I could live on a big plot of land with all my immediate and extended family. And I feel like that’s how things used to be only a few generations ago.

Anyway, don’t wanna rant to much. Objectively speaking, I’m wondering how much of this is me (my life decisions and growing pains have a affected my current situation tremendously no doubt) and how much is it the culture I am living in? Where can one find communities in this modern age? It is all a symptom of urbanization? If so, how do we learn to connect within it? Any positive outlooks or success stories on the topic would be much appreciated right now.

edit:

Well I woke up this morning to hundreds of messages from other people who feel the same I guess haha. You know I do wonder if reddit attracts the sort’ve “loner” demographic (I mean that in the nicest way possible). So it may be a bit biased (also because of covid) then say if you were to just ask people on the street. I value all of your opinions never the less. Sorry if I can’t respond to everyone. Been scrolling through some of these threads and people have made very awesome points. I think most comments were about others feeling the same. I have been thinking about this problem really since High School (I was very lonely in High School) but I kind of formed the post in way so I could hear how others felt as well. I find there is a ton of value in the schools of thought of Gabor Mate, Dr. Matthew Whoolery, Russel Brand, Johann Hari; there many others I could mention.

The happiness of individuals is a multifaceted problem absolutely. But the pursuit of individualism and self oriented thinking is a deep-seated problem in Western cultures. And it has only gotten worse over time with the advent of social media and internet culture. I think a positive thing for me personally and out of this has been a huge source of meaning and purpose. For me this is a very serious problem and major theme in my life that I could see myself really become apart of a solution. And I am young enough to realize this fact to stop it from happening in my life and the lives of others.

**If anyone takes anything away from this post please watch this video:**[The Harvard study of Adult development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI&feature=youtu.be) (one of the longest scientific studies ever conducted) found that the number one indicator of contentment in a person's life was how many strong positive connections they had to other individuals. It found that loneliness was as a powerful a sickness as smoking or alcoholism. The longer we don't identify this fact, the longer we live an a delusional state. The fact that western countries focus on individualism or placing higher importance on money than relationships is literally killing us according to a in-depth, 80 year long, Harvard study.

4500,"Why is the majority of social pressure on youths to avoid spreading COVID-19 to elderly people, yet elderly people don’t seem to be taking their own safety seriously?","During the quarantine, every time I’ve gone out for supplies the grocery stores have been filled with elderly people, and it doesn’t seem like they’re only there to stock up on essentials. Mostly they seem to be going about their daily business.

4505,Why do dogs barking not annoy everyone?,"I'm not a dog owner so please take this into consideration when reading this. I just don't understand. I recently went hiking in the woods and setup my hammock to relax for a bit. From the time I setup, relaxed a bit and took down my hammock which was around 2 hours I could hear a dog barking constantly in the distance. Because of the barking my hammocking wasn't really relaxing. Dogs barking incessantly drive me crazy. I don't mind the occasional ""hey what's up"" or ""yo owner what's over there barking"" but the nonstop for no reason for over an hour barking drives me crazy. 

I don't understand. Why is the dog barking? Why isn't anyone making the dog stop? Isn't it annoying everyone around them? If your neighbors dog was barking all night keeping you up at night why doesn't the entire neighborhood do something about it? Is everyone else immune to dogs barking? Does dog barking drive anyone else crazy? What do you do about it?

Edit: Holy crap this post blew up. I'm so surprised. What's more surprising is the responses I've received. I have 3 kids so I know the difference between good parents and shitty parents.

4523,How do I tell my parents I can hear them every time they have sex?,"I have absolutely no clue what to do about this and I need help. Yes, this is as gross as it sounds. My parents go to bed pretty early, at least compared to me. The issue is that our house is kinda creaky and sound travels pretty easily. Whether I’m downstairs, in my room, or in some other area of the house, it’s pretty easy to hear the insistent creaking of the bed and floorboards and the awkward grunts and moans. It’s not like they have it every night, and sometimes not even every week, but I think it’s making me go crazy. My brother has to be able to hear it too, so we’re both suffering through this. Hearing your parents somewhat loudly bang is about the second most awkward thing in the world. The most awkward thing however, would be telling them I can and to quiet down. I have absolutely no idea how, or if I even should, go about telling them. Part of me thinks that it’s not even worth telling because it’s not like they can stop floorboards from creaking. The other part of me would pay and sum of money to never hear them do it again. Please give me advice on if I should tell them. If you think I should, please tell me how I should.

4524,Why are younger generations so obsessed with broadcasting that they are not straight?,"So a couple of days ago my gf got this message from one of our younger friends. She's around 21, we are 26. This friend was trying to convince my gf that she can be bisexual without actually having done anything with another girl, ""just checking girls out is enough"" she sais, so my gf should just claim being bisexual. What she didn't knew is that my gf already is bi and had a relationship with another girl, but she keeps it private, not telling everybody, because she sees no point in doing so.

As we laughed at her attempt to explain bisexuality this question just popped into my head. Why do people, younger generations especially, feel the need to broadcast their sexual orientation so much, to the point where it's starting to look more like a religion.

To give you an example. This girl went to a new years eve party with her bf. The party Whatsapp group had the name new years eve gay edition and the description read: every straight person discovered will be kicked out. So she got her bf to pretend that he's bi as well. Is the sexual orientation the new music genre debate? 

When I was 15 people were split up into music genres, that was their core component that made up a big chunk of their personalities. Is the same thing happening nowadays with sexual orientations? I am aware of the fact that some people really are bi or gay etc, I'm talking about only a segment of the lgbtq community. 

And again I'm not trying to downplay sexual orientations, but just SAYING that you're bi, to me seems exactly as easy as saying you listen to x genre and *poof* there you have it, a crowd of people just like you (based only on sexual orientation) ready to accept you for who you ""truly"" are.

Edit: me being 26 means that im also part of the younger generation.... And trust me, there is a huge difference between 26 and 21, but most of you that are over 30 cannot comprehend it, i really don't understand why.

4533,why is a female life more valuable in an emergency than a Male?,I'm a Male and was in an emergency situation. A bomb threat at a bank. Why do women get evacuated before men? Ain't we supposed to be equal?,TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x34fc72a90>,1655149188.0,"So googling and reading on the Birkenhead it seems like no one actually says the reason. There is a practical reason more than just morality:

The British navy found that during chaotic evacuations, especially during flooding, people would be pulling against each other to try to get ahead. Frequently men would pull over women and children creating delays from the pileups and overall hurt the chances of everyone. The idea then became that the smaller, weaker people should go first and then the stronger people (men at the time) would then go and if they pulled against each other or the hull they would have the strength that it might not create a huge pileup. 


Just imagine a flooding ship in the pitch black darkness. Everyone poring out into hallways desperately grabbing and pushing trying to get out. Women and children often were trampled and overwhelmingly casualties of sinking ships consisted mostly of women and children. The Birkenhead drill aimed to change that.

Edit: to everyone complaining about the at the time bit; yes the average male is stronger than the average female however in this day and age I would hope that we are intelligent enough to recognize that gender is a lot more complex than that and hormone levels play a huge component in someone’s physically. You can say all you want about the averages. My hope with that line is that today we are smart enough to tell strong people from weak people without resorting to having them drop their pants. Some women are stronger than some men. The average goes one way but we are humans we are all about those outliers.

Edit 2: for a modern practical example look up the MS Estonia

Edit 3: bomb threats are different. That evacuation is about not letting the potential bomber know you are evacuating so that they won’t be tempted to detonate early.

Edit 4: most disasters kill ten, hundreds, or very rarely thousands. In a population of tens of millions, thousands don’t matter. In modern populations of billions thousands are a rounding error. Disasters don’t affect population growth. You don’t need to save “breeders” because the deaths from any single disaster (with the exception of something like bhopal) can’t actually impact the growth of the population in any significant way.

Edit 5: if it wasn’t clear women and children grab and trample too in panic inducing situations. The difference was when a man grabbed another man they we less likely to both fall over creating a pile up and then you get the station nightclub. They weren’t trying to stop grabbing and pushing they were trying to stop people falling when grabbed.",14649

Of course, there is grift everywhere, but in a system where those on top closely manage distribution of resources it’s going to be worse. 

There are also problems of incentives to do beyond the bare minimum for people, or rather the lack of those incentives.

4556,Why do we have to have a same sex kiss in a children’s / family movie?,"I’m a liberal atheist and I have nothing against the LGBTQ+ community. I have gay friends and I completely believe that being gay is not a choice. 
I’ve actually been always on the side of the community in any arguments from conservative family or friends. 

The controversy surrounding Lightyear’s same sex kiss doesn’t make any sense. To me it’s fine I can watch the movie with my 4 year old daughter and I’m sure she won’t make anything of it. As she grows older she will be asking questions and I’m 100% ready to answer it. I don’t believe any kid will turn gay by watching this and I’m not afraid of it. 

My question is why does Hollywood have to go that way anyways. I feel that all productions are going out of their way to include LGBTQ+ content in it. Even though we don’t go out of our way to include handicapped characters, people with Down syndrome.. etc

I’m not arguing I’m genuinely asking what do we gain with including such content in productions and specially in a family movie?

Thanks

(I’m gonna get downvoted as hell 😂)

EDIT: Thanks for all the amazing comments, I respect your arguments and im trying to make sense of life around me just like everyone else. In some way those arguments could help me more in my discussions with conservative people specially the prospective of gays and queers growing up without representation. That’s mainly why i asked this question and it’s great to have wonderful minds like yourselves give me their points of view.
Thanks again

EDIT 2: I didn’t mean to be offensive to anyone and i apologize if anyone got the wrong impression from this. On the other hand I’m also seeing a major problem in our society now that anyone with an opposing view is immediately marked as a troll or a homophobic conservative pretending to have no issues with gay people. I’m getting great comments and help from civilized people but some are just plainly aggressive and i don’t see this as a civilized way to have a liberal discussion. The very definition of liberalism is to be open to other people’s points of view and have healthy discussions on topics without labeling people.

EDIT 3: This really blew up, thanks for everyone who responded in a decent manner, I guess I like to pick people’s brains to get a conclusive overview of a topic that helps me come up with my own points of view and have a solid understanding of a subject. 
There is no way I can respond to all the comments here so I’ll generalize few points. 

First of all I do see now how representation could be helpful to queer kids in helping them not feel alone or different

I would have to say now that given the option I would choose to have no sexualization in any way (not heterosexual or homosexual) in a kids’ movie. After all it should just be fun and we can imply love without having PDA. But you guys are right if we have kissing then it doesn’t matter if it’s heterosexual or homosexual. 

Lastly I do think that (even though that could be of benefit to society) production companies and big corporates in general are jumping on that train purely for financial reasons, it is trendy, and it’s the current issue and everyone wants to make a buck out of it.

~~There are numerous studies showing teenagers associating themselves with different identities, sexual orientations and genders to seek attention and empathy. There was a podcast interviewing people who changed their gender as teenagers and now think they did it for the wrong reasons. So just like worrying about queer kids being isolated we should worry about kids that might get too excited about something without fully understanding themselves. 
There is a famous YouTuber who once made a video wondering if he was successful because he REALLY IS or because he is black and being given a special treatment. Sometimes when societies push for a change forcefully it could have an inverse effect in a way or another and that’s why I believe we should have a delicate balance~~. 

Thanks again to all the wonderful comments and I wish I can answer every one of you. And for people who just decided to throw some insults. Sorry if that was too offensive. I still believe we need to discuss all our issues openly if we want to advance as a civilization.

 I don't put questions like ""where did you meet you spouse/significant other?"" for password reset questions. What if my marriage doesn't work out and then I come back to this question but I have forgotten the answer because I'm no longer with her. I'm extremely happy in my marriage and I don't see a divorce in the future but I know it's a trust issue. I trust her more then most of my family but I don't trust anyone completely.

Also I know that I'm obnoxious, annoying and talk way to much rather than listening sometimes. I just can't seem to shut up when I topic comes up I know a lot about.

I know I get jealous easily, not in my relationship, but in my professional life. If someone gets a promotion higher than or equal to my position I can't help but think they don't deserve it because I'm smarter than they are. Even if it's not true. 

I'm insecure about my intelligence and have to rationalize why they are smarter then me.

4567,"Why is racism on Reddit considered okay against some groups, but not against others?","Just witness the huge amount of solidarity for BLM on Reddit, including by the site administrators. People have been (rightfully) denouncing racism and police brutality against blacks.

However, I don't see such a level of site-wide solidarity expressed towards many other non-white groups. To the contrary, racism towards others gets tolerated, or even encouraged. For example, there are plenty of comments calling Indian people ""rapey"", ""creepy"", scammers"", etc with blanket generalizations, and getting hundreds or thousands of upvotes for it. For example, a lot of comments for [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h0sxv5/aita_for_telling_some_indian_friends_that_they/) were outright racist. I bet if ""Indian"" was replaced with ""black"" in the post, it would have been taken down very quickly, with mods possibly banning the user. [Here is another example](https://np.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/gwrivs/an_indianamericans_take_on_racism_in_nz/). A lot of times, people justify the racist comments by saying how it is ""cultural"", when I bet they don't truly care about the issues, and just use it as an excuse to be racist (if they did, they would attribute stuff white people did to ""culture"" too, which of course they probably never would on this site). Sounds like fake ""wokeness"". Luckily, in both of the linked examples, mods eventually locked the threads, but on some more mainstream subs such as AskReddit or worldnews, mods have taken no action on vitriolic and racist comments against Indians.

I've also heard about East Asians complain about racism they get on this site, and how mod action is not taken against it.

One thing which makes this hypocritical is how some of the very same people (often white) who are outspoken about BLM, police brutality, and ""equality"", say vile stuff about Indians, Chinese, or other non-black groups.

My anxiety was through the roof, and for the first time in my life I dealt with insomnia (that shit SUCKS). I cried all the time. 

My work closed due to Covid during the initial shutdown and I took the opportunity to interview for jobs. I got two offers right away, one paying $10k more than I was making and one paying $17k more! I ended up taking the lower paying one to address the work-life balance issues I had in my last job. I LOVE my new job and feel so valued and fulfilled. I then moved in with my boyfriend in a BEAUTIFUL apartment. I'm not stress shopping so I've been able to save a decent amount of money.

- This seems to be an issue in just the US.

- It doesn’t seem to be about cultural appropriation, since many cultures have had this hairstyle because locks naturally form when someone doesn’t wash their hair.

- it’s more that there are double standards due to these hair styles. White people can wear them in the work place, but some black people can’t. Also, people seem to view the black hairstyles as unprofessional but typical white hairstyles are not.

I talked to my therapist about this and he said it sounds like stress and overwhelm, and that these thoughts aren’t that unusual for someone dealing with what I’m dealing with. But really, does anyone else get those kinds of thoughts? 

Side note: for whatever reason, having something happen that lands me in the hospital for awhile seems to be the only thing that comes to mind in these situations. I think the story in my head is that if I’m laid up in a hospital bed, no one will have any expectations of me (except getting better, I suppose). Even on vacation, there are tons of expectations. I think it usually involves a automobile of some sort because of the statistics of automobile related deaths.

4616,How to get brother to stop masturbating in the same room as me?,"Okay so my little brother just turned 13 and we are sleeping in the same room while I’m home for the summer, I’m 21. We have to share a room and a bunk bed and every damn night he masturbates right beneath me and it’s driving me fucking insane, the whole bed literally shakes and it’s disgusting to imagine that he’s doing that, especially right beneath me. Yes I masturbated at that age but I had my own room and I didn’t do it if there was someone in the room with me. It’s disturbing and annoying hearing him literally yank away while the bed shakes and I can hear the noise of him doing the act. Sometimes it lasts for over 20 minutes. I try to say “what’s all that shaking” or “what’s all that moving around, stop” he doesn’t seem to get it. How can I make him stop or realize I know he’s doing it?

UPDATE 1: So I just had the talk with him. He was a little embarrassed at first but I made sure I made him feel comfortable and what he was doing was natural and normal, however I made it clear doing it with other people in the room isn’t okay. He agreed and I told him that he could talk to me about anything he wanted!

The store displays the price they are charging for the item. Tax (or the money the consumer will pay the state for the purchase) is added at the register. In the US, sales tax is a percentage decided on by the state government, not the federal government, so it is a different percentage depending on where you are.

I’m currently in public and there are kids popping balloons, giggling, and having an absolute blast. Cute right? Well it makes me curl with annoyance and I just don’t get how people think they’re cute. I guess I just like peace and quiet and kids are the opposite. 

I’m 24f and people keep telling me I’ll want to settle down, get married, and have kids once I find the right person, but honestly that just seems like a nightmare. To me, they seem like all work, annoyance, a LOT of money, and for none of the respect and appreciation parents deserve.

Edit: grammar

Edit 2: didn’t expect this to blow up, ok. 

My first question is to all the people who don’t like kids, but like their own. Did you plan on having children? What was your mindset before and going into parenthood?

I must say though, that a lot of times is annoying to encounter children outside of school. Are they screaming in the classroom? I can politely ask them to keep it down, because their behavior is my business. Outside school? Not my business, and if the parents aren't bothered by their screams, most likely they'll be offended my me asking them to take care of their children.

4624,How do I turn down a special needs girl without looking like a terrible person?,"At the risk of sounding like a douchebag, I need to find some help with this. Some background, I am a 16 m in high school and I share a gym class with this girl who is friends with my second cousin who has Down syndrome, they are both part of a special education program that my school provides. I can definitely tell she is special needs and english is not her first language as she doesn’t understand some of the things I say when I speak and her accent is very thick. But she laughs at everything I say and keeps playfully touching and/or pushing me, even though I have told her twice before to stop touching me and I don’t want her to touch me. I do not reciprocate these same feelings and I do not know how to respond maturely and appropriately. It has gotten to the point where I am being approached by her and she ends up trapping me in a conversation until I can make up and excuse to leave it. I don’t want to continue doing this and I need to know what actions I can take to resolve this

For the record I don’t really have an opinion on the matter, it’s just I don’t see why fat women get society behind them supporting them, but it seems like fat men are criticised and mocked for being fat- by the same people a lot of the time? ",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x35b51a210>,1543320461.0,"Because the Fat Acceptance movement has close ties with feminism, and feminism is trendy and sells well.

Being ""feminist-woke"" is an easy way for a company to earn some credit. And this kind of pop-""wokeness"" just hasn't expanded to men yet.

Add to this that lot of the few people who are actually very serious about fat acceptance are of the opinion that men can't complain about it and has no place in the movement, so men are pushed away.

4627,Why is “can black people be racist to white people” asked every other week and consistently gets popular?,"This may be downvoted to hell, but I don’t really care at this point. So far, I’ve seen at least three posts make it big that are all essentially asking the same question: “What’s with the racism against white people?”. I’m not against discussion, and I believe a lot can be had over a topic as polarizing as race, but one of the other posts has a bunch of discussion on it already. Maybe it’s just me, but I like hearing genuinely new and interesting questions, not ones that have been recycled again and again.

EDIT: I didn't expect this to blow up this way, so thank you all for that. I wish to clarify a few things for everyone commenting.

1. I am white.
2. I believe racism is a multifaceted issue that cannot be ""broken down"" in any way. It has layers that go back hundreds of thousands of years.
3. I believe that while white people can be victims of racism, it is nothing like what POC have to deal with. We aren't being attacked, discriminated against, or harassed for being white. Sure, there may be a comment here or there, but it in no way compares to the amount of hate laved at POC for centuries. ""Cracker"" isn't a slur in the way the n-word is, please stop trying to compare the two.
4. My policy is to just not be a dick. I hope you all can agree with me on that.
5. Many people have accused me of karma whoring - I'm not. I am/was curious as to why people asked those questions that have been asked and answered many times before.
6. I did not make this post as another place to have discourse about this topic, please try and refrain from that.

To everyone reading this: have a wonderful day and thank you for deciding to look/comment!

EDIT 2: I really, really didn't expect this to blow up like this so thank you for the silvers, golds, and platinums. However, I'm reading through the replies and I'm realizing that people are having the same debate those other threads were having which I DON'T want. The definition of racism is ""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior"". I won't argue that or try to change it, that is the definition. My question was simply, why do people decided to question that and make a whole thread about it.

The 2 bombings shortened the war by a year and a half.  The military had estimated the war would not have ended until late 1946.  

While it gets little attention, the US sub campaign had nearly completely stopped food from getting into Japan.  Parts of Japan was already losing people to famine.  Had the war gone on until the end of 1946, it's been estimated one million additional Japanese would have died from famine.

The estimated death toll in allied casualties for an invasion was huge.  The military minted so many purple hearts in anticipation of the invasion that it didn't have to have more printed until around the time of the Iraq war.

The Japanese had used about 2800 kamikaze attacks by the end of the war.  They had 5000 planes in reserve to fight an invasion.  Additionally, they had trained kamikaze scuba divers.  They would have been outfitted with an explosive Lance.  When a landing craft passed over them they would strike the craft with the lance killing themselves and destroying the boat.  There were also orders that if an invasion started, all POWs were to be killed to free up all resources to fight the invaders.

A lot of the atomic bomb critics will ignorantly say there was no need to drop the second bomb because Japan was about to surrender.  Here's something most people don't know.  After the first bomb there was an attempted coup against the emperor by the heads of the army because they were afraid he might allow a surrender.  It was only the second bombing that convinced their military leaders to give up the fight.  Before the second bomb was dropped, the Japanese did reach out to the USSR to be a broker in peace negotiations.  The Soviets never communicated the overture to the allies.  The Soviets had no intention of working as a broker for peace because they were looking to start a war against Japan in the summer of 1945, just a few months after the German surrender.  The Soviets were looking for pay back after the Japanese beat them in Russo-Japanese war from about 30 years earlier.

The Soviets had plans to invade the northern island of Hokkaido and the Kuril islands.  Had the war not ended when it did the cold war would have also included a divided Japan in addition to a divided Germany and Korea.",3138

It’s horrible. 

It’s also counterproductive to making the world a better place. There’s so many children out there that need a home and so many responsible people wanting to adopt. So what if they don’t make like 80k or whatever a year? That doesn’t mean they’re incapable of bringing home a child and taking care of them. Why are adopting agencies so strict?

4653,Why do people get all mad about being 'friendzoned' when they're the ones who fuckzoned their friends?,"*Update: I do not know how to close this thread so I'll just leave this here. I received way more responses than I thought I would (I was expecting maybe 10). I'm trying to read and respond to as many comments as I can but it's a lost cause at this point. However, I appreciate all your responses: many well thought out explanations out there. The perspective that made the most sense to me is that some people see offering emotional support as a 'relationship' thing and not just a 'friend' thing, and if someone offers or receives it, it can be construed as romantic interest. This was insightful and makes sense to me (although the lashing out at rejection is something I can't get on board with.)*

Post:

I see a lot of people getting mad about someone not dating them even though they've been a shoulder to cry on, driven them to the airport, and helped them move etc. It's called being friends, and it's totally reasonable to expect them to do the same for you. What is not reasonable is expecting them to date you because you 'put in the time.' And yet people are guilted for friendzoning others all the time. Why don't people have the same rage for the so-called friend who basically used their friendship as a transaction for sex?

Edit 1: Even though I did not specify genders, I see that most people instinctively felt like the friendzoner is a woman and the friendzoned is a guy. Make of that what you will.

Edit 2: The word 'fuckzoned' may be misleading. I mean wanting a romantic and/or sexual relationship instead of 'just' friendship. It's not wrong to want this, it's the usual reaction to rejection that I have a problem with.",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x35f4f16d0>,1616834359.0,"I read some thing can’t remember where that help put this whole Friendzone bullshit in context.

4655,Why did God punish Adam and Eve if he knew they would sin?,"Quick note that I'm not religious nor a hardcore atheist. This is just a shower thought that keeps reoccurring in my mind.

In the bible it says ""God is omniscient"" (Psalm 139:1-6). He knows everything, including the future. God knew Adam and Eve would sin. If he created them and knew they would sin, why did he punish them? It wasn't even a small punishment so that they can gain a life lesson. He banished them from the garden and made childbirth incredibly painful for ALL women, not just Eve. It just seems like he set them up for failure?
I searched for answers online but the only one that provided an answer other than ""it's part of his master plan"" is that he did this because God has to display his greatness - his glory and his wrath, and that cannot be seen without the fall of mankind.
By that logic, God creates problems so that he can assert his dominance? Why does he have to show his greatness by making his beloved creations suffer? Can't he do it by showing Adam and Eve a super out-of-this-world magic trick?

Edit: I'm looking for insightful interpretations, maybe from people who are more familiar with religion? This is not for extreme atheists to use this as an opportunity to bash on religion. I am genuinely curious to see if there is perhaps a perspective I'm not seeing this in.

Edit 2: I'm getting some more responses like ""There is no logical answer"" and again, I am trying to see if I missed something from a religious point of view.

They would have stayed in the Garden of Eden forever and never had the chance to earn their place with God back in heaven, nor would they have had children and created the entire human race.  When Eve sinned, she gave future generations the opportunity to choose between good and evil and earn their way back next to God.  There's more to their belief than that, but that's the general gist of it.  Mormons also don't believe in Hell.

1- I believe most people will view whatever music they listened to around high school age through their mid-twenties to be their ""classic rock"".  The music that they will think of as the best period of music with the most personal meaning for them.  

2- As it has become much easier to produce music solo and on a much lower budget, it is now possible for almost anyone to record and distribute an album.  This means that what was once reserved for people with real talent and money making potential is now available to anyone with a computer.  This is great, but it does mean you're going to have to sort through a lot more material in general.

3- Relating to point 2, the way we buy music changed dramatically when streaming and downloading became the norm.  When you used to have to buy a CD/tape/record and there was only one good song, but you paid $15 you might think negatively about the artist overall.  However, if I like one Taylor Swift song, but overall don't enjoy her music, I didn't directly pay any money to listen to that song so I don't mind.  This means artists can achieve a relatively high level of exposure and success without having a catalogue of music that is good, you just need that one song.  Basically, you have a lot more ""one hit wonders"" than ever before.

4- It has become harder to find something you might enjoy unless you know how to look.  Streaming services and YouTube will push specific artists regardless of how they match your taste.  This isn't new, radio stations did this, but I've found it's much less likely I will discover a new artist I like while streaming than say, browsing music at a brick and mortar location when I was younger.

5- Music has indeed changed quite a bit.  The music we produce as a culture will always change in tone and substance as generations progress.  This is good and normal, but might mean the type of music you prefer is harder to find and there may be less artists creating content you enjoy.

TLDR: Music industry changes lead to marketing changes mixed with cultural changes lead to difficulty in finding music you enjoy.",3058

The best thing is to get out of the situation before it becomes violent. There is no shame in running away.

If you are in a life position where you can get a dog, and you are willing to make that commitment, a German Shepherd will be your best friend. He will defend you with his life, and most people have a visceral fear of being bitten by an animal. Trust his judgment of people; if your shepherd immediately alerts to a person, trust that and remove yourself from the situation.

If you walk/hike, carry a walking stick.  Not one of those fiberglass/carbon types, carry a wood stick that is 115-120cm long.

4676,Do children really not owe their parents anything for raising them?,"I've seen this sentiment echoed multiple times on Reddit and coming from an Asian background, I find it hard to believe this. In an Asian society, children are expected to do chores, show respect to their elders and take care of their elderly parents/grandparents when they retire.

I agree that parents should not expect anything from their children, but I've been taught that taking care of your elderly parents and being respectful are fundamental values as you should show gratitude to your parents for making sacrifices to bring you up.

Additionally, does this mean that children should not be expected/made to do chores since they do not owe their parents anything?",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x361743090>,1597195557.0,"I think the word that people are seriously offering here is ""owe"". 

Ideally, in a happy, functional household, the kids will have their physical and emotional needs taken care of because that was the responsibility the parent(s) took on when they made the choice to have a child. In turn, because that child is raised responsibly, they will care enough for their family to stand by them and help in any way they can as they get older. 

However, in a less than ideal family, it does not mean that a child MUST do these things simply because their parents did the bare minimum in raising them. It's a matter of expectation - just because YOU made the choice to have a child does not in turn mean that child is required to care for you. 

From what I've seen (growing up in Western culture), when a child had a happy upbringing, they continue to help care for their family willingly, because that is what family does. But when that had a poor upbringing, their families are more likely to demand that they help care for them, despite having not shown the same care when the child was young and needed it most. In the latter situation, the kid does not owe their family anything.",6896

Severe pain, 

Literally google dark purple and look at the first image I’m not kidding.
I think I broke my penis 

Update: I think I may have lost blood supply to my dick so I’m tryna get hard 

Update 2: no time to check for erection I’m leaving the house for the hospital. Be back in 10-15


Update: it’s bleeding 

Update: I can no longer feel my penis 

Update I have arrived at hospital will update in about 30 minutes if I survive.

UPDATE WENT TO THE HOSPITAL MY DICK IS BROKE 😂

FULL STORY UPDATE

me and my gf had sex, she was riding me and I felt some really ducking bad pain and a snap like noise but I kept going for some stupid reason. After she went home (10-15 minutes later) I noticed my dick was changing fucking colours. Posted on Reddit, went to the ER. 1 hour fucking wait (EDIT: IT FELT LIKE AN HOUR IM NOT KEEPING TRACK OF TIME KNOWING I COULD LOSE MY DICK) in the waiting room, and one doctor later my dick is broke. 

Have no idea why they made me wait a fucking hour. But then again Nova Scotia hospitals are pretty fucked up. Many other patients with minor injuries got in before me for fucks sake. 

I’m calling my gf to tell her because god knows when I can have sex again. The doctors don’t know what’s gonna happen to my dick yet. They are still assessing the damage that happened before I came  to the hospital. They told me waiting so long was not a smart move. 

Broke my dick and was staring to lose blood supply GO ME

JUST FOR CLARIFICATION IM NOT A GODDAMN TROLL and please pray my dick will work again.


Update: doctors should be back to see me in the morning, my dick has bandages and stuff. They gotta get the right treatment, some special dudes coming in tmrw morning

Even though I don't celebrate Christmas or care for dates in general, being this lonely again makes the whole thing so much worse. I lost way too many relationships this year.

Identical twins are split from the same egg and were fertilised by one sperm. 

They likely have the same size penis as they are identical in basically every single way (besides things like fingerprints, DNA isn't exact, etc).

However, there are environmental factors which can have an affect and result in differences. For example, if one twin...developed an eating disorder during their teenage years, a lack of nutrition may stunt their growth. This can then result in a smaller penis than their twin. So lifestyle and environment can have an impact on their physical appearances and may result in changes.

But if they have the exact same lifestyle, then they likely have the same penis size.

...

Fraternal twins are not from the same egg, and are both fertilised by a different sperm. So there are two eggs and two sperms involved. The two eggs were ""accidently"" released at the same time, and they were both fertilised. 

This means that while they are twins...they won't look exactly the same. Just like how we don't look exactly like our siblings.

So...fraternal twins likely don't have the same penis size.",6429

Today I have a soft higher-pitched voice and I most definitely didn't actively work towards it. I assume it's due to the fact that at the ages where my adult voice was developing I mostly talked to girls and subconsciously I must have copied their pitches ending up with a naturally higher speaking voice. It's not that I'm incapable of speaking in a lower more ""manly"" voice, it's just more comfortable for me to place my voice higher.

It's kind of a curse, I can't answer the phone at work without actively changing my voice before I speak otherwise I am always misgendered as a woman without fail.

I have never had a good birthday and have really been struggling these last few years, but thanks to all of you and your immense kindness, this will be my first memorable birthday. For the first time in my life I can say that I am looking forward to celebrating my birthday. I will always look back on this year with fond memories. You all will never know how much your kindness and generosity means to me. May your lives and birthdays be forever filled with peace, love, and laughter. <3

My 21st birthday is coming up and I don’t really have any friends to celebrate with and the idea of just spending it at home like every other year kinda depresses me, so I decided I’d go spend the weekend at a hotel in my city and just order some good food. Is this a weird thing to do? Is it sort of pathetic?

Edit: Hey! I just want to thank everyone who has commented and left birthday wishes. Genuinely, you’ve all made me feel a lot better about my birthday, which I usually dread. I very much appreciate everyone’s suggestions, and I would have loved to have gone to a different country or even NYC but with the travel restrictions, LA seemed best (since it’s basically home). But nonetheless, I’m looking forward to trying my first real steak and legal drink (if my license arrives in time lol). Thanks again, everyone has been so nice and reassuring that I’m actually looking forward to my birthday for once!!

Edit: I never expected for this post to garner so much attention. I am truly thankful for every person who has wished me a happy birthday. I don’t have any friends in my life and just today I was thinking about the fact that no one would really wish me a happy birthday, and now suddenly, hundreds of people have and it means a lot. Thank you so much for making me feel more “normal” and less sad about this decision. I’m actually pretty excited now, and have even started making a list of places i’m going to order food from lol. It might seem dumb, but your kind messages have made my week a little brighter.

Edit: My birthday is this coming Sunday and I will definitely post an update then, to let you all know how it went. :)

Edit: Wow this really blew up! Thank you again for such kind birthday messages. To everyone who has offered to buy me a drink, I just want to thank you sincerely from the bottom of my heart. Truly, it means so much that any of you would want to send even $1 to an internet stranger for their birthday.

My current gf thought it was surprising when we first started dating, but she said in a good way. Now on the other hand this topic came up with some friends yesterday and they thought it's super 'weird af' to do that and they've never heard of a guy buying tampons or pills just in case.

Edit: The BC is the one prescribed to 80% of women where I am and I get the prescription renewed whenever necessary by my gp. He thinks it's ok to have a pack at home for safety reasons when you're sexualy active.

Edit 2: I am in Austria, getting BC is not an issue if you're older than 12 and sexualy active - even as a man. My insurance covers it too. According to this comment by a professional I'm not the only one:

4714,"Why is there such a focus on ""canceling student loans"" instead of just canceling student loan interest?","Background: I graduated from college 8 years ago. Upon completion, I had borrowed a total of $42,000. However after several false starts attempting to get settled into a career, I had to defer payments for a time before I had any significant and steady income. By the time I began making payments in 2015, my loan balance had ballooned to roughly $55k.

After 6 straight years of paying above the minimum, as well as a few larger chunks when I recieved sudden windfalls, I have paid a total of $17,989

My current balance? ....$44,191.00

Still a full $2,190 MORE than I ever borrowed. 

If the primary argument against canceling student loan debt is that it is not fair to allow people to get out of paying back money they borrowed, I can totally support that. I don't expect it to be given for for nothing. I used that money for a host of other things besides tuition. Rent, clothes, vodka, etc. So I'm more than willing to pay back what I borrowed. If INTEREST were forgiven, my current balance would be roughly $24,000. 

Many students who have been paying longer than me have already made payments totaling GREATER than the sum of their loans, and could even get money BACK.

Seeing how quickly my principal has dropped during the interest freeze due to the pandemic has shown just how much faster the money can be paid back if it wasn't being diverted and simply generating additional revenue for the federal government.

(Edit: formatting)

Edit 2: Clarification-
All of my loans are federal student loans used for undergrad only. Its a mixture of ""subsidized"" loans with interest rates between 2.8 and 4.5%, and several ""unsubsidized"" loans at 6.8% which make up the bulk. Also, I keep seeing people say that interest doesn't start until after graduation. This is also untrue. INTEREST starts from day one, PAYMENTS are not required until after graduation. This is how you can borrow a flat amount of $xx,xxx, and by the time you start paying the loan balance has already increased by 10-20% before you've even started repaying what you borrowed.",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x366ce23d0>,1626128709.0,"Borrowed $16,600 originally.

Such as buying a pepper to find a part of it is a little squishy so you cut it out and throw it away, I then feel bad that piece of pepper grew from nothing, lived it whole life expecting to be eaten and then gets thrown away instead.

Or for example a piece of toilet paper. It started off life as a tree, that was sadly cut down, chopped up and presumably gone through some whole factory process (however they make toilet paper), and packaged up neatly. A delivery driver probably then drove through the night to deliver it to my supermarket, I selected it from the shelf, took it home, only to drop a piece on the floor and now find it icky so I just put it in the toilet, but now that piece is sad it didn't get to live out its lifelong dream of being rubbed on someones ass...

Edit:
Hey, it's been a heated conversation. To be frank I didn't expect to get all these replies and blow up. These all come back to the point of the user. Everyone has their own interests and can change with the upbringing and practices and vary with places and culture.

In 🇮🇳 India majority of the urban people mainly middle class have something called 'health faucet' next to European closet, which gives out a jet of water from its head part (I think health faucet is similar to bidet shower, IDK for sure. Just google health faucet and you will get the images), and moreover, we can manually adjust the pressure of water coming out with a simple lever like a thing. We mainly use the health faucet with the right hand and clean the but with the left hand (because in India most people use their right hand do eat food)

For more rural and lower-class people they mainly use a bucket and water for cleaning. It's just as simple as pouring the water in a mug with a right hand and cleaning butt with the left hand.

But nowadays most of the hotels also have an extra option of toilet papers for foreign tourists.

4742,Why is it ok to make white characters black but not the other way around?,"The new Ariel from the little mermaid is black, James bond is now a black lady, and the one I just watched was Anita Darling from the Cruella movie (good movie btw). I brought it up to my wife and she said it didn't matter and I was being insensitive, but a character is a character - and it never happens the other way around. People would be pissed if they cast a white woman as Tiana in a live action princess and the frog, or if Frozone was suddenly Latino in the next incredibles film.

I just don't get it. Why do we need to make white characters black? Why not just have black characters? It almost seems racist to me like ""all the good characters are white so we will just have to take one over for the sake of black people"" instead of actually being respectful and making badass black characters like Frozone, black panther, Tiana, etc.

Why does this happen all the time, and why is it only ok in one direction?",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x36acd27d0>,1622499005.0,"There are two types of characters when it comes to race: There are characters where race is a relevant aspect of the character, and there are characters where race isn’t a relevant aspect of the character.

Characters in the former category should only be changed if you are intentionally trying to do something interesting with the character and you’ve put a lot of thought into it. Characters that fall into the latter category can be played by anyone and it fundamentally doesn’t matter.

It so happens that, historically, the overwhelming majority of characters where the race wasn’t really a relevant factor happen to have been defaulted to white. Meanwhile, and somewhat consequently, most non-white characters were explicitly written as non-white and not as characters where race was a non-factor.

The end result is that the type of character who can and should be cast without much regard for the race of the actor has an overwhelming history of being portrayed as white and thus are more likely to be “changed” from white to something else in modern portrayals than the reverse simply because there are so few historical non-white characters who could be made white without significantly changing the character.",7697

I live in a ""abusive"" situation- idk what people call it but to me I feel like it's dysfunctional at best- abusive at worst. I don't want to go very in depth with what happened, but yelling, hitting, kicking, trashing, and alot of weird.. spanking shit happens where I am. (i dont even know if its sexual man)

I always considered calling CPS or getting help. They have come over to my house 3 times, one being mandated reporter and 2 being because I went to a hospital and told them what was happening. I would have probably went in depth or tried to actually advocate for myself, and I kind of regret not doing so. All 3 cases were dismissed due to a mix of ""not enough evidence"" and how everyone was so carefree about it in my home. Right now I am having a feeling of doom, like I know that my parents will begin the screaming matches with me again.

I recall that when people are taken away by CPS they go to a foster home, but besides that it gets vague for me. How long does it take to be taken away? Is there a legal process? Do they just appear randomly or will I get a heads up? Will I be able to go with any pets or siblings? How much am I allowed to pack? will my parents know my new home? Theres alot I want to know and I'd appreciate if someone would write a small timeline for me.

Along with that, I'd like to ask is it really as bad as people say? I keep hearing horror stories of foster kids being abused and hurt, sometimes killed. Some go to worse homes than before, yada yada. Is this the majority? Do most kids end up worse than before or is it the media overexaggerating? Is there a good chance things will get better?

Please comment even if you cant answer everything, i'd appreciate it :)",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x36c5eb3d0>,1603181787.0,"Everyone’s story is different! I had an abusive mom and my parents were divorced. My dad was in the picture but only had very partial custody of me and I saw him about once a month. 

One day I finally had a mark that I could show my teacher at school so she’d take me seriously if I told her what was happening at home. I was afraid if I didn’t have evidence I’d be causing a fuss and then get in worse trouble. Here’s how it went down for me. 

I, young child, show up to school with a mark on my face. I work up the courage to tell my teacher what happened during lunch. She pulls me aside after recess or whatever and has me come tell another adult alongside her. They talk amongst themselves and decide it’s urgent enough to call the police. The police come, take pictures of my marks, interview me and take notes about what happened for evidence in court. Then call my dad to come pick me up from school that day. My mom shows up to get me - cops are like, nah, not until this is cleared up. My dad takes me for the day but then eventually I have to go back to my moms because there hasn’t been a court case yet to prove anything.

My dad hires a lawyer to help fight for custody. His side of the family shells out ~10k+ in legal fees. I spend the next couple of months at my moms in hell, taking notes in a *very* secret journal about the bad things that happen. Now a days it’d be good to upload these entries to a private place online where she can’t ever see them (new gmail account with strong password & no backup email for example). 

I gather enough evidence in my journal for the lawyers to make a good case that my life is shit. CPS comes to ensure my dads home will be safer for me. They approve. I move out of my moms house and any future visits with her are supervised. She moves out of town. I barely talk to her anymore and she hasn’t improved much as a person. 

That’s my experience. I was very fortunate to have a family member that would fight hard for custody of me. You’ll need evidence. Good luck, you don’t deserve this shit. Go to college, it’ll be so worth it. It’s a guaranteed escape from your shit family life and it’ll prepare you for the real world where people aren’t all insane and abusive. 

Just remember- this isn’t your fault. *What you’re experiencing is real. Don’t let anyone try to tell you you’re overreacting/too sensitive.* 

If you can’t get out now, get out during college. Find friends with healthy families that can help nurture and support you. Exercise, eat fruits and veggies. Play and have fun while you’re still a kid, whenever you can. You’re going to be wiser and stronger from all this and you WILL get through this. 

Peace and love to you, sweet human.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the kind words and awards!! I’m doing a lot better now and I’m glad this comment got some visibility. There’s so much shame entrenched in abuse so I feel grateful to be able to talk about it here with you all. 

For anyone who’s reading this and wondering how I’ve coped with this as an adult - I’ve learned about what it means to have Complex PTSD - C-PTSD (r/cptsd) and have done a lot of research on mental health problems that I believe afflicted my mom. I’ve been able to get low-cost therapy through my college (by PHD candidates) and state insurance, as well as some affordable out of pocket community psychologists (not psychiatrists)

Subreddits like r/RaisedByBorderlines and r/RaisedByNarcissists have been very affirming and informative for me to better understand what happened to me as a child. OP might want to check out those resources too for some extra sanity.

4758,"In American politics, why are we satisfied voting for “the lesser of two evils” instead of pushing for third party candidates to be taken more seriously?",,TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x36d0447d0>,1598285658.0,"It's not so much that people are ""satisfied"" with this - they clearly aren't - but that the electoral system doesn't allow for a multi-party system to establish itself long-term.

There are numerous reasons why third, fourth, fifth and sixth parties don't manage to accumulate significant power as they do in other developed countries. The most important of these reasons is the simple-majority based voting system.

Say you want to be voted into Congress (House of Representatives). This means you need to run for that office in your voting district. Now, let's imagine there are 5 candidates. One of these candidates receives 40% of the total vote, while his competitors all receive 15% each. This means candidate A has just been elected to Congress **despite the fact** that he never actually reached an absolute majority. 60% of his district wanted someone else.

This already problematic system gets further undermined by anti-democratic tactics such as gerrymandering and the influence of big money in politics. However, the simple-majority system is really a big issue.

Most European countries, by contrast, vote their representatives on a proportionate basis. For example in my country Switzerland, we have a list-system. It works like this: In every Canton (= state), every political party creates a list of candidates. Those lists usually consist of roughly 60 people, although most of them won't actually get elected. Now, let's assume the elections give us the following results: Party A = 30%, Party B = 25%, Party C = 15%, Party D = 15%, Party E = 10% and Party F = 5%. Let's assume the lower chamber of parliament (House of Representatives) consists of 400 seats total. This means Party A will receive 120 seats, Party B gets 100 seats, Party C and D both receive 60 seats, Party E gets 40 seats and Party F gets 20 seats. These seats are now allocated to all the different Cantons (states) according to how populated they are. For example in the US, Party A might give 30 of its 120 seats to California but only 5 to Vermont. In every state, the top candidates from the list are elected. This happens with every party. This kind of proportionate system does not only allow a multi-party system, it actually *encourages* a multi-party system. Thanks to the proportionate representation, small parties still get a pretty decent representation in parliament and they have the opportunity to fight for minority interests. In the US, by contrary, small parties get ignored and swallowed up by the two big ones. If you are a Green Party candidate, you have no chances of ever being elected President or even Congressman, despite the fact that a decent number of voters want you.",2806

Edit: But there is one thing that I'd like to say.

I believe that life is not always worth living, and that's pretty obvious for most people. If your life consists of only working to delay the inevitable, where you lose the ability to enjoy life itself in the process then what's the point? It's obviously not worth living in this case.

This question always comes up when you need to make a change. You need to make your life worth living. You are the one living, creating your life. Do not fall into the deterministic attitude of passively watching things fall apart. You have the power to die when you want, and in how you want. Who you are when you go. If you are not who you should be, then I would say you still have time to become who you are, before letting it all go. 

This life is not worth anything unless you are doing something else with it. Unless something else is happening with you, that makes it worth it. It would be a terrible catastrophe for you to die on the earth before having made the journey that makes it worthwhile. 

The reason why it is not given to you automatically is because it is *your* journey. These are your barriers to break, obstacles to overcome, to become who you really are. If you look at this drive to suicide closely, you'll find that it is the same as the drive to change. To discard this life, and begin anew. It is not a drive towards cowardice. It is a calling for those who are brave.",2166

4763,Why are gay pride events so over sexualised?,"Right off the bat I'm not a homophobe and I completely agree with LGBTQ+ rights. I do not have any gay family members but have gay friends, but on top of that I have regularly attended gay pride over here in the UK and love the freedom that these people who were once oppressed now have. I am not gay myself but I want equality for all sexualities and am happy to be an ally. 

What I don't really understand is why some of these events are so sexualised. I recently saw some posts on FB from a gay friend of mine and he was literally lying on the floor with his whole ass exposed in one picture. I've been to pride where men and women have been dressed up in BDSM gear, some dressed as puppies and stuff. Why does this stuff have to be associated so heavily with gay pride? I'm straight and I guess I don't need to celebrate that fact, but I wouldn't expect other people to want to see me and my partner engaging in sex acts in public, or even see me with my ass or penis out in public. In the bedroom I believe we should have the freedom to do whatever is consensual, also in modern society there are literally clubs devoted to these kinds of sex parties and stuff for consenting adults and thats awesome. 

But why do we have to see that kind of stuff at gay pride events? Especially when there are kids around and stuff?

No, homosexual people aren't all deviants, it doesn't make sense to tar a whole sexuality with one brush simply because some of them do stuff you don't like and to say so is very ignorant and immature. Also I've tried to be as honest as possible with my question and I did not intend to spread any bigotry or hatred towards people in the LGBTQ+ community. Thanks for the honest answers about the history of the LGBTQ+ community, I genuinely wasn't aware of how sexualised the history was.",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x36d66a6d0>,1562595614.0,"In general, sexual freedom has been tied to LGBT rights across several political movements. Especially during the AIDS crisis, when sexual health education was paramount, explicit discourse about sex became very common in LGBT protests and the inclusion of sexual themes became more common (obviously, its tame in comparison, but for example, kissing was a large part of marketing campaigns and protest as both a symbol of visible gayness and as a pushback to all of the dehumanizing and exclusion centered language and social treatment that people with AIDS faced-- the kissing protests were a way of saying ""we're here, we're queer, and touching people with this disease cant hurt you"" when most people still didn't understand how HIV spread and fear was rampant.)

But even earlier, in the Stonewall era, LGBTrights were tied explicitly to sexuality, both through sex work and sex clubs. Sex work was not an uncommon occupation for LGBT people, especially trans people who were largely excluded from standard jobs or those who had to leave hostile families because of their orientation. Additionally, sex clubs were some of the very few designated places for gay people to meet, socialize, find people to connect with, etc., especially in larger cities. Because of this, gay kink kink communities have always been at least tangentially connected to the LGBT movement in general, especially in places like New York and San Fransisco. 

So this accounts for some of historical reasons for the sexual openness often attached to Pride. But more simply, Pride has been and is often still considered a time to be shocking, to be the most brazen and public version of your orientation, and to fly in the face of the stifling conditions that society has held for LGBT people for all of our history. That leads to some serious letting down of the hair, to such an extent that some may see it as just acting out. And some people do just embrace a really out there sexual lifestyle. That's true of straight people as well, but straight peoples' orientations and sexual practices haven't been so directly tied to politics and protests, so you dont see such an organized display of kink attaching itself to any particular public events. 

I will say that this has not been my Pride experience. In recent years especially, there have been a lot of pushes to make Pride family friendly, at least during the general parades. Of course, its still a huge celebration, but I think most of the rowdiness is relegated to going out after Pride or to specific adults only events. People take their kids to the day activities, and I've never seen anything inappropriate, just some skimpy outfits that were by no means inherently sexual (usually costumes rather than kink gear.) Its becoming less sexual.",2850

Thanks again!",TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x36d8b4510>,1621204412.0,"This is a really tricky question to answer neutrally.

The super short version is that after WWII, Britain created Israel as a refuge for Jewish people. Except it did so right on top of Palestine (which was a colony of Britain of the time, and was a traditionally Islamic region), then ditched and said 'good luck, not our problem'. Since then, there's been a lot of fighting and wars between the two groups. There's two peoples, one land (and not just one land, one with a whole ton of extremely important holy areas for both religions), and both 'valid' (in some sense) claims to the area. They both feel like they're defending themselves from outsiders.

In most recent times, Israel has had the upper hand (due in part to support from the West, especially the U.S.), and has controversially claimed certain areas as rightfully theirs. In some case removing Palestinians to move in Israeli's. The current party leading Israel is their hardliner party.

Both countries have a mix of opinions- there are hardline Israeli's who think the area is theirs(usually for an explicitly Jewish state) and don't want to compromise, and some moderates. And vice versa, Palestine has hardliners who don't want to compromise, and some moderates. The more blood that gets shed on both sides makes compromise more difficult.

In general the whole situation is kind of fucked and there's no easy solution that would make everyone happy, at this point.

edit:

One minor clarification, based on feedback: Judaism has a connection to the region from Old Testament times. The area has been under continuous conquered/converted/occupied (including Islamic) since then, but there's been a small existing population of Jewish people, just much much smaller than the post-WWII immigration population. So it's not that Britain randomly picked it from scratch in 1948- there's historical connections/build up, which is what i meant about valid claims/holy land; not just that Britain put Israel there.",8608

The OTG is the one that you hear about smiting cities and taking vengeance on sinners. Part of the point of Christianity is that Jesus sets up a new covenant, or understanding, between God and humanity. This might sound strange but you can think of the stories in the OT as being based on the stories of a primitive people. ""Why did the plague of locusts happen?"" ""Because God was angry."" 

Jesus came along and said that was incorrect thinking: God loves everyone unconditionally, even people who sin, and he doesn't go around destroying sinners. If people are destroyed it's because God has given us freedom to explore the consequences of our actions and therefore doesn't interfere in the world.

Think of it like a game: if you were playing a game and every time you were about to die someone stepped in and saved you, it probably wouldn't be a very interesting game and you wouldn't learn much since you are basically invincible. So God doesn't interfere directly in human affairs because it would take away the reason for existence and our ability to grow as individuals and as a people. But I digress.

tldr: the Old Testament God is the angry one who kills people, Jesus said that's not the way it is, God loves you and bad stuff happens because it has to for free will to exist.

Edit: a few people asking about why God allows bad things to happen. A response to /u/AustonStachewsWrist:

>So the all powerful dude didn't do it? Or we're just pretending he didn't do it? Or, he did it and he's learned not to do it going forward? 

I see what you're saying but I think the correct option is (1) God didn't do the bad things in the Old Testament, we just thought he did. Humans were primitive back then. Very few were literate or capable of the kinds of theological discussions we're having here. Back then, if the Sun rose, people wondered why and in the absence of science they just concluded that ""God did it"", just like the earthquakes and the floods and everything else. Jesus came along and said, ""God didn't do those things -- he loves you."" Then people might ask why God would let those bad things happen? 

This is harder to answer, but it's possibly due the fact that we grow as individuals by experiencing hardship and pain. That's a difficult pill to swallow, I know. Especially when you're in pain. I get it. I think it's a bit like the parent who needs to let the child make their own mistakes so that they can learn and grow and become happy. God does the same for us. Of course, people inflict horrific pain and suffering on others. When we look at the pain someone goes through we have to balance it against the other part of Jesus' message, which is that God will grant us all eternal life in paradise. Compared to that, what is a few years of pain on Earth? Especially if by experiencing pain we can become better people? There's an excellent quote by John Keats that sums things up:

This wouldn't surprise me if a vast amount of the community weren't so clued up on science, and also if they didn't care about the environment.

I come from a strict religious background and even though my mum supports me, she keeps repeating to me about how I shouldn’t ever tell anyone especially my boyfriend that someone assaulted me. She was like this before I met him. She kind of makes me feel that there is something wrong with me but when I talk to her about it she’s understanding? She tells me that people will judge me if they knew and that ‘mud’ sticks. 

I am now 21 and I have been dating this empathetic man for a while. I really like him and see a future with him. 

My mum keeps telling me I should never tell him anything of the sexual assault, what I went through and it gives me a lot  of anxiety. For example, I have constant fears that he will leave me if he knew or if someone tells him anything just because of what my mum keeps saying to me. Is this true? 

One day I’d like to talk to him about it but I’m not sure if it’s just because I want him to accept me because my mum has made me feel like there is something wrong with me.

4797,Can you get someone charged for farting in your sandwiches?,"My friend’s wife used to make up a sandwich every evening for him to take to work the following day. Recently he found out that whenever they had an argument she would fart into the sandwich multiple times as she was making it. The only reason he found out is because she let it slip to a friend while drunk and the information got back to him. He says it really disturbed him and actually brought him to tears. He said for months he had been noticing that his sandwiches sometimes tasted “funky” and sometimes had a weird musky scent. He had actually asked his wife on a few occasions if she was sure the meat she was using was still in date. They’ve now separated as a result of this revelation and he doesn’t know what to do about it. Someone suggested that he could report it to the police but does anyone think the police would take that seriously?

Edit: A lot of people are asking if it was through clothes or bare cheeks. He doesn’t know for sure, but usually she would wear loose pyjama shorts in the evening so the farts would have pretty much made direct impact either way. Others are asking how she could have farted “in” as opposed to “on” the sandwich. The answer is she was farting between the layers of bread and filling. 

——————————————————

UPDATE

He’s trying to get her charged with attempted murder.

——————————————————

2nd UPDATE

After obtaining professional legal advice he has been warned that seeking a charge at that level is very unrealistic and he risks making the case unwinnable. In order to be in with a chance of any charge being made whatsoever (even at the lowest level) he needs at the bare minimum: A) a full confession of the events, and B) evidence of similar behaviour occurring in the past. 

With regards to section B, he says he actually did walk in on her farting on a chicken kiev once, but let it slide because it still had to go in the oven anyway and she said it was a prank. Never in a million years did he ever imagine she would have progressed to cold deli and that is why he is so distraught.

He’s working on getting that confession.

——————————————————

3rd UPDATE

He confronted her about it by phone in order to try and get a confession, simply asking “Hello, why did you fart in my sandwiches?” She obviously knew he was recording the phone call because she denied everything. However, she may have slipped up by saying “Good god you are so ungrateful. I really busted my ass making those sandwiches for you.” He asked her to say the last sentence again slowly, but she ended the call and wouldn’t answer from then on.

I grew up in a pretty mixed community so I never felt like I was any different from the other kids. Even though I was bullied, it was never because of my race. One thing you should know is that referring to people by race isn't as common here as in the US. Mostly you refer to people by ethnicity. I'm referred to as ""Antillean"" a lot more often than I have been referred to as ""black"". That's not to say that I haven't had my fair share of racist experiences, but they didn't really affect me that much. They never stopped me from achieving my goals.

As for systemic racism, I don't know. When I think of something ""systemic"" Apartheid or Jim Crow, or even redlining comes to mind because there is an actual ""system"" in place that reinforces racial discrimination. I also think belief in race and racial differences is a prerequisite to calling something racist. I feel like people refer to things as being racist too often while they are actually xenophobic.

I also don't think racism (or xenophobia for that matter) is a result of capitalism. Tribalism is an innate feature of human beings. Separating people into groups of ""us"" and ""them"" and claiming moral or intellectual superiority. What we now refer to as racism used to manifest as tribalism, nationalism, classism, etc, way before our contemporary capitalist society came to be.

I have always been strong academically which is something that my parents prioritize over almost all else. My brother, on the other hand, while he is incredibly smart (this is an objective fact- my parents were very much the type who had us both tested as toddlers and then reveled in the cult of ""giftedness"" and all the allure of having ""genius children""), he has never performed as well in school. 

Throughout our lives, our parents and teachers have always compared him to me- it doesn't help that because we are twins, we are often taking the same classes and interacting with the same people. As of recently, my parents have just increased this comparison of the two of us now that we are starting the college application process. 

I've seen all the posts on reddit where people in my brother's situation resent their parents and sibling and how they cut all ties with them as soon as they turn 18. I don't disagree with the notion of cutting all ties with our parents- I'm planning on doing that as well, but what should I do to help my brother and show him that I am not our parents- that love him and don't think that I'm better than him and that I really want to keep him in my life and am on his side.

4818,What’s the point of wearing a mask into a restaurant just to take it off and leave it off?,"I’ve been having a hard time understanding this one, especially when it comes to dining out at restaurants.

It’s like that there’s an invisible boundary surrounding each table where Covid can’t get to you or your party. But once you leave your table, you must have it on.

It's hard to explain to people who haven't seen it or can't empathize with it, but a lot of people with serious self image problems will go out of their way to have their self-loathing validated. I noticed that seemingly happening quite a bit in there.

I will also throw out that a lot of people seemed shocked that bad judgement does not mean someone has broken the law. It might, but not the way you expect it to. The ""what if...?""

4860,Is it unreasonable to expect not to have to babysit when first dating a single parent?,"I have always said I have no issue dating women who have a kid/kids from a previous relationship but lately I'm questioning it. My mother was a single mom for a few years before she met my stepfather and not once was I ever left alone with anyone else she dated. Even with my stepfather, she'd been dating him for quite awhile before I ever met him, let alone stayed alone with him.

It seems like most of the time, though, when I start getting together with a woman who has kids, I'm almost immediately expected to babysit. I don't like this for a couple of reasons. First of all, kids are hard work. I work a physically demanding job 12 hours a day and on my time off, I want to have a chance to relax and trying to keep some wild kid from killing themselves isn't my idea of relaxation. I don't like the responsibility, and it skeeves me out that they barely know me and yet are willing to dump their *child* off on me. I could be a fucking murderer for all they know and they're going to leave their most precious gift with me having known me for two weeks or something? That's just fucked up. If they'd do that with me, who else have these kids been left with? What have they experienced?

I get that having a kid is hard, especially on their own, and I don't mind helping but I just don't want to be a babysitter before I even get to know them well enough to decide the relationship is worth pursuing. And the worst part is, then I feel guilty as fuck leaving the woman because I worry about who she'll leave her kids with next who might not be as harmless as me. It's all around shitty.

4861,Why is reading a book seen as the ultimate productive pastime while other activities like browsing Reddit considered a waste of time? I feel like I learn so much just from going through Reddit every day.,,TooAfraidToAsk,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x378d36910>,1607264265.0,"Although we do feel like we learn a lot from social media, how much deep, comprehensive knowledge on any subject do we actually receive from it? Social media convinces us that we are learning a lot from it but in reality we are, for the most part, just filling our heads with an incomprehensible tangle of surface level ideas which would never really benefit us in reality.

Books, on the other hand, should excel in explaining the subject you are reading them for, as long as we assume it is a good book in the first place. They provide more in-depth content and allow for more meaningful discussion than the ill-informed ""hot takes"" that cloud the internet nowadays. You can argue that individual books only focus on specific things while the internet excels at giving you a wide variety of trivia about the world, but what's more useful, buckets upon buckets of random trivia that fills the mind or a deep understanding on those specific things you could just know eye-grabbing facts about? I'm not saying that all information one gets from the internet is worthless. There are tons of very informative websites that can teach you things you would have never been able to learn pre-internet just like how there are tons of books that wont. Those are great, I'm just talking about social media, like Reddit.

Moving past the idea that books usually will educate you better than the average dose of your social-media slushy, lets now talk about the artistic benefits of reading books rather than the more quantitative educational benefits.

Alongside music and art books have been one of the most dominant mediums for artistic expression throughout human history, and for very good reason. Books are like fertilizer for your mind and imagination because unlike movies or video games (which are artistic mediums in their own right) everything inside a book relies on your imagination to realize it. Alongside the imagination it influences, this allows books to have a higher tendency of being more ""vague"", or up to the readers interpretation, unlike movies or music or art which all necessitate their own amount of interpretation but to an arguably lesser extent.

But of course, not all books are that great. As with all mediums of thought there are good ones and bad ones. No one expects you to benefit from the complexities of a book like twilight just like how no one would find it worthwhile to study the plot of a transformers movie. At that point arguing that social media is preferable wouldn't be completely unfair, although I still think its healthy enough for the mind to be worth something.

I ended up going on a bit of a tangent, sorry about that. This is all more or less just my opinion too, so take it with a grain of salt.",3168

I constantly have to tell people I’m too busy. Too busy to come to their houses for GOT, too busy to visit with my grandma. I’m too busy to go to my boyfriends parents house and have dinner. You get the idea. 

Basically I’m either: 
- getting ready for work (shower+makeup+outfit+driving there=2 hours prior to my shift)

- at work

- at home after work eating/sleeping/shitting 

- at school (the two days I have as a “weekend” are the two days I go to school) 

- studying 

- doing laundry, cleaning, grocery shopping, getting gas, etc 

What I don’t get is, how are adults who work full time able to have full on lives with unique hobbies when I can’t even find time to visit my grandma for a day? I feel like it’s just a given in the US that everyone is gritty enough to work 40 hours AND clean the house AND have a social life AND have a bunch of side hobbies that dictate your personality. Nobody ever questions it. 

Even people who don’t go to school, it’s like you only have 48 hours each week (Saturday and Sunday) to actually do what you want, and most people need time to clean and to relax and recharge before working the next week, right?

A mix of salaries are higher in the US (also, when we compare, we tend to use pre-tax salaries. other countries don't), and also demographically the type of people who post on reddit tend to be in those well paying jobs.

4880,Is it weird that I check on my family every night after they fall asleep?,"I’m 18m and I live with my mom and 9yo sister. I’m always up late gaming and sleep around 5am. Every night when I go to use the bathroom or get water and I remember that they’re asleep, I do a little check up on them. I told a friend this and he said I was super weird.

Here’s the usual routine: 

I head to my moms room and her door is usually wide open. I usually just glance around the room and make sure she’s sleeping soundly.  I close or open her window depending on the temperature, make sure her phone is plugged in and being charged, turn the tv off if it’s really loud, sometimes I even have to put her blanket on her because it fell to the side of the bed, and lastly I turn the light off and close the door.

I wouldn’t even call that a process because usually it just takes a moment ya know? Most times it’s just me glancing around the room, turning the light off and closing the door. 

 I just make sure everything’s in place and safe because my mom does sleep over at her boyfriends house sometimes and takes my sister so it’s kinda just routine to see if they’re home and I guess me checking on them might be weird but it’s just me making sure things are in order and they’re safe.

My sister has her own room too, I pretty much do the same thing with her but very rarely there are times she’s sleeping in positions that look unsafe or uncomfortable. Stuff like with her arm bent around her back, over her head, or sometimes it’s just her straight up sleeping FACE FIRST into a pillow. 

So sometimes I walk over and just… move her out of what I perceive as an unsafe or uncomfortable position, It never wakes her up either. this is rare but it happens probably at least once a month. Is this weird at all? maybe I have some mild OCD

Ps Im kinda introverted so im often in my room with my door locked as Im online gaming and I’ve just gotten used to having it locked to avoid interaction and for some reason that makes me always wanna close my mom and sisters doors when they’re asleep too. And yeah I grew up poor so I always make sure the lights are off too

Edit: 19* turning 20 soon

 Edit: for the people curious on if I have a some sort of compulsive need to look at people sleep, truth is I have more of a compulsive need to make sure everyone’s lights and tvs are off and doors closed because I grew up poor so I’m used to making sure our electronics are turned off to save energy, and late at night I like to have my room door open while I game and listen to music and I don’t want to risk waking anyone up.

 But turning off my moms tv is usually a must because that shit be loud sometimes and I feel like I’m turning it off for myself more than for her because I like the silence

Edit: yes they know I do this. I often tell my mom things like “wow you fell asleep with your tv real loud last night I turned it off and plugged your phone in for you.” And she’ll just say thanks.

Edit:  I am introverted a bit, that’s true but I am just as extroverted! I just value being alone a lot. I actually kinda have a LOT of friends, I talk alot, and I love making people laugh. Main problem is I have a low social battery and my mom or sister annoy me sometimes so that’s why I keep my door closed. Me checking on them Is not me trying to spend time with them Or anything like that lol now THAT sounds weird

Edit: I work from 8pm-12am. I don’t lock myself away from them completely, my sister often comes in my room to play games with me or even just watch me play, and I talk to my mom a good amount. 

There are times when my mom goes to sleep with her door closed and locked already and I don’t think twice about it. And for moving my sister yeah I can understand that sounds weird I just move her every now and then if she looks uncomfortable because I feel like she’d wake up with her body hurting or when she falls asleep face first into a pillow I turn her head so she can breathe properly.

4885,Is it normal to have a hot dick?,"To be clear, I mean tempature wise. The least of my worries is my dick being too attractive.
  
I've always been that guy that is hot no matter where I am. The beach? I'm hot. In a tempature controlled room? I'm hot. How about in the middle of a snow storm? Well I'd probably just be warm but I think you get my point.

 Sometimes, and this has only happened a handful of times, my hands get very warm, like to the point where it hurts. It feels like someone has quickly put a lit match on my finger tip then quickly put it out. If I focus for a long time I can kind of do it on command but It takes literally all of my attention. It may sound like a super power but it's more like being able to point your eyes in two different directions. It's useless and I look like an idiot when I'm trying to do it.

Anyway, I'm beating around my bush here, there is one part of my body that gets hot on a regular basis. My ding-a-ling. Now I should preface this by saying I'm a teen. And like any other teen I got a butt load of hormones that are a great nuisance on my mind. So to quell the unholy demons that plague my thoughts, and because I can't get a real girl to touch my Johnson. I decide to do a little hanky panky with my little Frankie. And when I do, it gets hot. (Again I mean tempature wise)

I'm guessing because of blood flow? Its not too hot ya know? Usually I can ignore it and carry on with my civil duties, but recently it got so hot I had to stop. I couldn't keep a handle on my literally hot dog. And while I didn't burn my hand, it definitely hurt for a while.

Anyway, I guess this is just a long winded way of saying, should I be worried? Is this normal?  Is my meat too hot to beat? If I do find a girl, does she need to have an equally hot pocket? What should I do about my human torch? I know this may not be a huge deal, just wondering if I'm the only one.

Footnote/TLDR: I know I joked alot in this post but seriously, my dick is hot and I'm wondering if it's normal. (Can't stress enough that I'm talking about tempature here.)

However, the number of people suffering mentally in a way or another because of lockdown, restrictions, job losses, grief etc. is not mentioned very often, and are much more difficult to count, just because there is no easy ""mental health PCR test"" that you can do.

The reason it seems overrated now is because it’s an old formula that is getting pushed off of TV slowly (crummy one liners and laugh tracks). The thing about it is that, when it came out, it had a very uncommon plot and set up (at the time). Most sitcoms of the 80s and 90s were based on a family, and they celebrated family values, except for shows like Seinfeld. Friends was about young adults trying to get by with their lives. It’s a cliche and tired set up now, but at the time it was fresh.

Is this a normal thing? Or should I be concerned? 

Edit, as it seems to relate to some comments: 

I’ve noticed a slight increase of these thoughts recently.

Furthermore, I find myself worrying about things that don’t need to really be worried about. Quite often now that I think about it. Such as the idea and worry of a family member suddenly dying. “What if mom and dad got in a crash on their way back from a night out?” Is a common one, especially after 1am. You get my point.

Edit #2 because two people have brought this to my attention and writing it down helps me get a better understanding. 

Also, I might as well write another seemingly related question here. 

Does anyone else hide the knife in their kitchen for fear of knocking it over and stabbing yourself in the foot? Even if it’s a decent ways away from the edge? I do that sometimes. Some have said that this was odd but I’ve never thought of it as out of the ordinary? Like I just said, it always seemed normal.

EDIT4: lmao, what a shitshow. RIP my inbox. Make it stop

EDIT3: Well, I'm pretty flabbergasted. It seems like people DO 100% trust their partners. You can stop downvoting me. I wasn't trying to attack your holy principles. I was merely asking a question about something that I cannot wrap my mind around in the slightest. No need to feel offended or attacked. I always assumed people meant it figuratively when talking about complete trust. Looks like they didn't...

EDIT2: Another question that came up in my mind: Why do people react so harshly when someone is questioning their trust? Is it because im challenging/questioning the validity of their world bearing pillars, so to say? Why are people becoming so hostile over a ""simple"" question?

People always talk about how important trust is, that they trust their SO without doubt and that you can't have a proper relationship if you don't trust him/her completely.

I've always found this odd. I have never trusted anyone completely and never will. Imho it's naive thinking. I think that anyone can be corrupted and that you can't even trust yourself. (I haven't had any ""traumatic"" events in that regards either; if that's what you're thinking)

Right now, I know that I wouldn't cheat on my SO, but there is no way knowing that it'll stay like this in the future. One might ""slip up"" while being drunk, One might just meet their ""soulmate"" and cheat on their SO on a whim. Realistically, you cannot have 100% certainty. Yet some people seem to have that. Are they all delusional? Is it some kind of protection mechanism? I want to understand.

EDIT: well, I'm getting a lot of shit. Not sure why people are getting this mad exactly. Maybe because I'm questioning their loyalty. So far, I still haven't really understood how people 100% trust, but apparently many just do it. I can only assume that it works like religion (Which I also don't understand at all). You simply trust because you do, you simply believe beause you do, there is no explanation/reasoning/logic behind it. Must be nice for you people to be able to think like that.

4910,Why do feminists tolerate Muslim culture despite it being extremely sexist? [please read below],"I am a feminist and an ex-Muslim who left the religion because it was excessively toxic for me. Now, I realize that women have the right to wear whatever the heck they want. But I saw this cringy-ass Twitter post that made me re-evaluate my feminism. It goes:

""Everyone wants to talk about Muslim countries that enforce hijab.

Western countries that force women to TAKE OFF hijab is not only the same form of control, but worse: it’s systemic anti-Muslim hate.

Forcing minor girls from a vulnerable minority to reveal their bodies is SICK""

First of all, what the fuck? Since when are minors who ""reveal"" their bodies sickening? It's called wearing comfortable clothes. Is that what she can only think of when it comes to wearing anything BUT hijab? Does she sexualize every single minor girl she sees? Classic Muslim idiocy, and yes, she definitely does. She's the sick one.

Secondly, how could she even DARE say a country that gives women their rights on a silver platter like France, NOT ONLY COMPARES, but IS WORSE than fucking Saudi Arabia! This is the most idiotic, the most absurd argument ever I've seen.

Third, she wasn't even fucking talking about banning hijab for every Muslim women. It was only banned for those who are under 18. I have a problem with this as well. I don't think parents have the right to shove their beliefs on their children's throats like that in the 21st century. It's called secularism, and I'm dumbfounded by a so-called leftist who's so against it.

I'll be real. Give her kind the right to vote, and France, a beautiful and free country, will become a shithole Islamic emirate. I won't stop until they stop being so fundamentalist with their views.

From a medical perspective, the most important difference between the two is that, in one of them, the patients mental health improves by psychological means like realizing that they are delusional about their appearance whereas physical improvements don't actually help.  

In the other, people feel better about themselves by actually changing their body/social role whereas denying their gender-identity makes them feel worse.  

On top of that, one is a mental illness with psychological causes. Gender Dysphoria, however, is technically a mental illness. It is the stress felt by the brain when sexual attributes do not align with it's gender identity. However, the usual cause of that mental illness: someone's gender-identity not matching their sex assigned at birth is not considered a mental illness, it is a neurological/biological configuration of the brain.

4942,"If drugs aren't allowed in sports, why is makeup allowed in beauty contests?","Yeah this is from a meme, but seriously why is this the case?
The reasoning for having no drugs in sports is so there's a more ""even"" playing field, and mostly so the athletes can win by their own hard work and ability. 
So why does beauty contest allow makeup, instead of having all the contestants come in bare-faced? Wouldn't that be a more accurate gauge of who is most beautiful?
This also goes for cosmetic procedures I guess, if they even allow it.

Using drugs in sports only works when one side does it in secret. Otherwise everyone would use the same ones and the advantage would go away. There are health risks to a lot of the drugs and other cheats, and most are not at all tested for safety.

In beauty pageants it's really unclear what is even being measured. At one time they were mostly about physical appearance but pretty much all of them have at least tried to claim that the women are being judged for other qualities. So what does it even mean to have an equal playing field.

Also look at the different places of make-up vs. performance enhancing drugs in society at large. Make-up has been part of the normal kit for most women for decades. Performance enhancing drugs are not only banned in sports but are generally something we try to keep out of schools and amateur sports, again for health reasons.

4953,Is it weird for a 19F to hang out with a 50M?,"I (19F) have known a man, ""Tom"" (anywhere from 50-60), who was a frequent substitute teacher at my middle school. I have known his three children who are around my age as my friends and have interacted his family fairly often growing up. I was frequently invited to dinner over at their house, to church, to housesit, etc. Now I am in college and I do not interact with any of them as often, though I was closest with his son who is my age.

However, Tom will contact me sometimes (infrequently) and buy me dinner, to hangout, etc. Today he suggested we go somewhere fun sometime this week. All of this is just him and I alone although it would make much more sense to me for at least one of his kids to be there as well. Hanging out alone without any of his family has been a new development. 

Today he said something along the lines of ""does it feel weird?/does it feel like we are dating?"" (In regards to buying me dinner). Often when I come over the house is empty as his son is at work, family is on a trip, etc. so it ends up being just us. He texted me, ""I hope to see you this week"" when I said I was not in town to be there for dinner with him. I will not lie it is a little off putting sometimes but I am not sure what to think. While it seems like a weird situation to be in, I do not think he is a bad person who would do anything weird. I have always seen Tom as a father figure type, but I can't help but wonder if this is a normal thing to do. 

Am I thinking too deep into this? Or is it weird to hang out alone like this?

Edit: Just to add, he does have a wife in case that changes anything. I know her the least out of his family as I never saw her much but they seem to have a normal family image.

My dysphoria arose early in childhood. I only played with girls and could never understand why everyone would get upset when I played with dolls, babies, barbies, or whatever else. I was bullied relentlessly in my early years for 'sounding like a girl' and 'acting like a girl'. I was a smart kid, and I worked hard to act like a boy as much as possible. I had to think about how to act like a boy and tried to stop moving my hands so much, not talk in such a high pitch, etc. Every. Single. Day. I knew something was wrong with me, but because I never heard of this happening to anyone I told myself that I was crazy and wrong. I hated everything about myself. I was too girly to be boy but too much of a boy to be a girl. I was depressed, alone, and couldn't connect with anyone because I was petrified that if anyone found out I thought I was a girl I would be sent to the loonie bin. Eventually at 14 I had enough and I attempted suicide and was found by my mother in time to have my stomach pumped and promptly awoke in a psych ward. 

After I was released a week later I was exhausted with life and decided to do some research. I was tired of being miserable and wanted some answers. Up until this point I was terrified to research anything for fear of finding out I was truly alone. I stumbled upon the term transgender and read into it for weeks and I decided that I would transition as soon as I turned 18. I sat on that information for four years and at 18 I saw a psychiastrist specifically for my dysphoria. They diagnosed me with gender dysphoria and recommended I get on hormones immediately. I declined the prescription and got a second opinion, and then a third, and then a fourth. Every single one of them agreed that my best option would be to transition with the help of regulated hormones and therapy. I asked every single one of them if there was an alternative and they said no, other than antidepressants (which weren't doing shit for me). Of course, I already figured this was the case but I had to be absolutely sure. So, I finally began taking hormones and prepared to spend the rest of my life alone. I knew I would never be taken seriously, I knew I would never be loved again, I knew everyone would think I'm a freak and I knew all of my friends and family would be dissapointed or disgusted but I was suicidal, miserable and desperate. I just wanted to feel any level of happiness and comfort with myself, whatever it took. 

My choice was to live miserably and inevitably kill myself or to try for the one chance of happiness I had in front of me. I took the gamble and transitioned. 

Sorry for the long answer! This is a question I see often and I just wanted to provide as much insight as I could as to why someone makes this choice.

Whenever I wear perfume, it lasts maybe an hour. I sometimes check and it's like it's already worn off. Sometimes I wonder if I just can't tell and others might, but I just don't get it! 

I think about asking what kind of perfume they use, or possibly a hair product, but I don't want to pry. Either way it makes me jealous because I can never get to that level of having my body leave a ""scent""!

Also, the new construction electricians  are often either apprentices or not actually licensed electricians at all, but the guy who comes to your house to fix that light switch or change out your can lights is often a journeyman  - this means they usually have 10+ years of experience.

Why do some people around me think that I’m selfish for not wanting children?

EDIT: Mental health has never been openly discussed in my family. We do not know how to properly express our feelings or successfully support one another in times of need. I grew up feeling invalidated, misunderstood, and unheard. My mom has anger management issues and sometimes it gets out of control.

The aforementioned reasons made me realize that parental emotional stability among children plays an important role in overall development of the children. If parents can manage their emotions in a proper way, this may be a strong tool for bringing success and happiness in the life of their children.

Well, about your question. You know, I guess it's all about the projections that any child has, and we kinda want that back. When we are kids, nothing is certain, everything could be possible (in terms of future jobs, careers, relationships, etc), god, I remember wanting to be something different each week lol. I guess that, deep inside, we want that feeling of being the ""main character"" of our lives. Being free to dream of whatever we want, believing that there is, indeed, good and bad (when we grow up, we discover that this is only a fairy tale thing) in life. Believing that we are, just for a moment, well... special. Being an adult sucks, nothing has any sort of sense, any sort of importance. It's all about surviving the most we can. Suddenly, being a rockstar, a football player, an actor, all of this dreams start to fade away. 

Well, I'm not saying that it's impossible to achieve any of those things I mentioned before. But being a kid, like... nothing has consequences, everything could be reached out.

It's not that it were only ""simple"" times, the thing is, those were the only times (for the majority of people) that we could dream and aspire for this things. When we could project ourselves living the story of a lifetime.

Their tips balance that out and they, more often than not, make a considerable amount over the state/federal minimum wage so...STOP BRINGING IT UP...literally 90% of the comments are about this.

Edit 2: If you're going to accuse me of not tipping and being a cheapskate or whatever spare me. No where have I said this nor do I believe it so stop with the personal attacks for simply asking a question. It's seemingly bringing out more guilt and rage then constructive conversation.

----------------


That server is going to, by law, be paid *AT LEAST* minimum wage at the end of the day, 99.9% of the time though they make a good bit more, so the whole ""in some states they only get $2 an hour"" doesn't really make sense. If not it's illegal so saying ""they don't do that where I work"" is a problem you need to deal with. This is IF you make less than minimum with combined tips. Results may vary (some states pay minimum plus tips...CA and OR pay $11+ minimum).

The cashier at Walmart is busting her ass day in day out for minimum wage and nothing else so...why don't you tip her? The person making your order at a fast food place is dealing with people all day, smile on their face, and also take your order, prepare it, make sure it's correct...why don't you tip all them?

Why do you think that it's only wait staff that are somehow more deserving of tipping and a living wage? Why aren't you tipping other people a mandatory 15-20% as well?

If you have anything new to add to the discourse that would be awesome! 

Like why are young girls 18+ the whole name of the game and rage of the season but when a woman gets wrinkles and grey hair she's losing her beauty? I never understood it. My mother was pretty as a young lady and young mum but when she got older she became far more stunning. Honestly, she's the most beautiful woman I know! She has long grey and black hair, crows feet, and kind wise eyes. She carries herself with such class and grace! She's confident and speaks up for herself and others. But she'd always complain how her grays were showing and try to hide any signs of aging on her. It bothered me so much growing up but she does that less these days thankfully. Still, I hate how society has taught older women they need to dye their grey hair, eliminate their wrinkles. Like, it makes no sense! How are middle aged women not just as stunning if not more than middle aged men? Why does it matter more to a woman to look young over a man? Why is the standard of beauty for older women basically ""try to look 25 again"" vs. ""trim your extra hairs, take care of your health and carry yourself with confidence?""

5002,How does a transgender woman know that they are a woman if they have been culturally brought up as a man their whole life?,"I have a friend who has recently come out as transgender, going identifying as a man to a woman. I have never really known anyone openly transgender very well, so I am trying to better understand her predicament without asking questions that could offend or come off as being insensitive; the last thing I want to do is have her feel like I am unaccepting of her coming out. 

That being said, I am having trouble understanding exactly how a transgender person comes to the realization that they are the opposite gender than the one they were assigned at birth. To be more specific, I don't understand how someone (being raised and treated like a man throughout their life) comes to the realization that they are a woman. My friend has never been culturally perceived or treated like a woman until coming out recently, so how is she so sure that she is one? Without any reference point through direct experience, how do transgender people truly know they are transgender?

Moreover, I think I am struggling to grasp the whole idea of gender as being either essential on one hand or malleable on the other. If gender is socially constructed, then how can this be parsed with a set of fixed attributes relating to gender identity. On one hand I have heard that there are gender norms that should be outgrown (a man should still be able to identify as a man even if they display characteristics that are normally associated with being a woman). Yet at the same time it seems like gender has to have some fixed characteristics, otherwise I don't know how my friend is so certain that they are a woman rather than a man who displays traditionally feminine qualities.

So do some men see a butt/boobs, be attracted, notice they look at least not 20, and then just turn off that attraction?

Say you're at the gym, you turn the corner and see a big butt. You are attracted, but look up and see it looks like a 17 year old. Do you just look away and put that in the ""nope"" category? Do you feel guilty?

I am also interested in this question phrased slightly different like, if you asked people in Germany who supported facism, what would be there reasoning for disliking Jewish people what would they say? All I was taught in school is there was no reason, it was just because of their race, and I don’t fully believe that. I also understand they may have had reasoning to dislike Jewish people that is completely inaccurate. I am curious as to what rationale was used that led to this atrocity.

Edit: saw a downvote right off the bat. Was also removed from nostupidquestions and when I asked a mod why he called me antisemitic. We learn about the Holocaust to prevent similar atrocities from ever happening again, which should include the rationale that led to it.

5035,How did my uncle die (help)?,"My mother won’t tell me how my uncle died. She’ll be able to tell me what happened in a few years, I think—it’s been years since his death already, but it’s still too soon.

I’m hoping that someone with more life experience than me can put the pieces together. Here is what I do know: 

- He died in his apartment, where he lived alone. I don’t know if he called someone first or was found after death, just that that’s the location he died.

- He was an alcoholic and tried to get sober a few times. I saw him during a sober stint once—he was yellowed, shaking, the works.

- He was a hoarder. It took days to “clean his apartment” after he died. I don’t now if that cleaning time was only spent on the hoarding, or if other measures needed attending to. I do know that my mom spent much time digging/sorting through his hoarded items , but I don’t know if that’s all that had to be done in vacating his apartment. 

- My mom confided in me that she always wonders if “they” could have done more for him. After this statement she quickly changed subjects, choking up, saying, “I don’t even want to think about that.” She had to calm herself down. 

- He did not have friends. He would talk to family over the phone every few days. 

- He died in his 40s.

I’m just seeking some understanding while I give her that time.",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x38caf2710>,1694763227.0,"Could have been liver issues, heart attack or any number of health related problems associated with heavy drinking.

Probably the most outright disturbing thing was when the youth group leader started molesting the teenage boys. They were around ages 13 to 17ish? Some of them were my close friends, but they never talked about it because they were so brainwashed and probably ashamed. Eventually the youth geoup leader took it too far with one of them, and he freaked out and told his parents, who in turn freaked out and wanted to call the police. The pastor asked them not to, that he would deal with it. They (the pastor and his cronies) confronted the pedo, who, like the slimy worm of a prick he was, decided to break down in tears and repent, minimizing his crime and begging for forgiveness, and the leadership all laid hands on him and prayed for him. This was not enough for the parents, who involved the police and basically assisted in a sting operation to get the pedo busted. In response to the drama it caused, the church had a meeting, during which one leader (pastor's son) got up and talked (literally cried) about how he heard some of the young men in the church were taking part in very sinful things (addressing the CHILDREN WHO WERE MOLESTED, not the pedophile), shaming them for their acts and encouraging them to come forward for prayer. Then the head pastor talked about how shameful it was for the family to call the cops and not trust god to bring justice inside of the church (they didnt want to make the news). The pedo went to jail despite the church's best efforts, and the victims (especially those that remain in the church) are forever tormented about what happened, feeling condemned for taking part in such horrid, ungodly acts.

5047,Why isn’t it legal to give people permission to eat your body after you die?,"Like, instead of burial, cremation, taxidermy, and whatever else people choose to do with their dead bodies, why can’t we legally say “when I die, I want to be cremated (or something else), but if my close friends and family want to eat my thighs or something, I’m okay with them doing so”?

As long as everyone who’s involved consents, it doesn’t seem like the worst thing to do. It could even be a somewhat spiritual experience for some people. I guess you’d probably have to cook the person first, though, because raw human flesh doesn’t sound the most appetizing and hygienic.

5048,I had a weird dream last night that the next plague was started by an ant infected with cordyceps had bitten an animal infected with rabies and then somehow infected a human with both.

Cordyceps affects a host and ""controls"" it to get the nutrients and stuff it prefers as the fungus feeds on the animal. Cordyceps is alive and an infection in an animal serves a purpose. 

On the other hand, rabies is a virus. It's not alive, and its ""goal"" is simply to reproduce while it drains the resources of whatever it's infecting. It doesn't care what the thing it's infecting does. 

If the two were somehow infecting the same animal, one would dominate the other, most likely the rabies virus since what it does it actively at odds with cordyceps. Can't get nutrients when your brain won't even let you drink water.

Assuming the rabies virus laid dormant, then worst case scenario cordyceps would just poison a person in a similar way to other poisonous mushrooms, and best case scenario it's the kind of cordyceps that's safe to consume so the bite poses no real risk (beyond now having the rabies virus in the person).",7

After prolonged starvation, a couple things happen to your body. One of them is you lose energy, I mean all that you have. Your entire body hurts when you move (especially muscle areas that are used to moving like arms and legs) because it's ""burning itself"" in order to get every small bit of energy.  
Your head will also hurt. Our brain is a machine working no stop 24/7, you can't avoid thinking and that requires energy. After you don't get enough energy you can barely move and think until you're almost numb to everything when you are conscious.  
You didn't mention anything about liquids but if you stop drinking too this will happen much sooner (and you'll die much sooner as well).

One tree takes up two 25ft from one another so. 25X167 you need 4175ft just to kill one person with apple seeds. Which would mean you need near 7-9k for the near 1 hectare of land and to plant a tree would cost you around £100/$110 so 100 times 167 is 167,000 along with the 9000 would be a grand total of around 155,000 to kill one person with apple seeds",19

if, somehow, you survived the initial ingestion, and you tolerated the chemical burns, and you were able to still breathe - you you would then receive signifigant internal burns from the heat of the cement as the exothermic reaction began during curing. presuming the reaction with your body fluids did not result in more carnage internally.

In order to prevent a possible global famine or environmental problems (global warming, environmental pollution, etc.), which are already a big problem, keeping the world population under control is a very convenient method, and to tell the truth, a DEFINITELY NECESSARY method.  The natural resources of the world will run out very soon and this gigantic order, where everything is made of oil, will be in an insurmountable stalemate. At the very least, I think governments are keeping the world's population in check to slow this from happening.  World wars, epidemics, and nuclear war are all terrifying things, but accept it or not, they're all necessary. I cannot calculate how many billions the world's population would have been if there had been no world wars or no epidemics, because I am not a mathematician, but with a simple reasoning: 

the worldwide fertility rate is 2 according to research. Let's say a 17-year-old boy marries a woman when he turns 25 and has 2 children. When these two children grew up, they married others and they had 2 children, and their children grew up, they married others and they had 2 chi… what if this child had been killed when he was 17?

I know it's unethical, but in today's world they don't do it that way anyway.  Have you ever thought? Why is the social welfare of states with a large population so low? because they want it that way. Can't countries like China or India reduce the crime rate in society by setting strict rules? Of course they can, both countries are in the top 5 largest economies in the world, but they are not doing it because they want the population to decrease silently. Remember, if you were born in North Korea, your knowledge of the world would only be as described to you. We are lucky not to have been born in North Korea, but what we know about the world is what governments reflect in the media.

>Why is the social welfare of states with a large population so low?

There is no causal relationship between the size of social welfare systems and the size of the population. The only meaningful causal relationship is that between the population pyramid of the country and the size of the social welfare system. Older population = smaller working population = less money = less social welfare.

>The natural resources of the world will run out very soon and this gigantic order, where everything is made of oil, will be in an insurmountable stalemate.

This is also not really true. In the 70's, the idea of 'peak oil' was very popular. And, whilst, technically true, the original estimates left out a lot of variables. According to the original estimates, we would have already reached peak oil a decade ago. But that hasn't happened. This is because technological innovations have led to more ways to find more oil. This means that peak oil is always 10 years away -- and it keeps getting further away. It's very possible that we won't reach it in a hundred years. By that time, we'll have already transitioned.

>In order to prevent a possible global famine or environmental problems (global warming, environmental pollution, etc.),

This argument is faulty because it assumes that human beings produce co2 *per se*. This is not the case. Humans do not inherently produce excess co2. We are totally able to produce less. It's just that our current economic system (capitalism) encourages infinite economic grown and consumption. This is unsustainable, but not a factor inherently attributable to humans as a species. Unless you believe that humans are inherently capitalistic.

Lastly, I want to hit on something very important. What you're currently describing is an acute problem that currently very much exists in Europe. The European population is not reproducing at a sustainable rate. As a consequence, the *governments of Europe* are implementing measures to prevent this demographic collapse. This is entirely contrary to your theory.

Moreover, looking at China, Japan and the US, these countries are also actively taking measures to *encourage* births.

Also, let me lastly make the following argument: if you truly believe that the world wars were staged in a global conspiracy, then you must assume that there is some global elite that has for centuries secretly controlled the world. There is no evidence for this. In fact, to the contrary, there is a lot of evidence against it. The world is absolutely filled with nationalistic behaviour that would be extremely contrary to some supposed secret world government. Although there are a lot of conspiracy theorists who love this idea, most of them are baselessly use the idea to justify antisemitism -- in particular Adolf Hitler.

In general, I have to say that I believe that your theory relies on an ingorance on very basic historical and political observations. I think that if you studied the policies of governments more, you would discover the opposite of your theory is true.",50

After a while, you just become numb to all of it. I rarely, if ever, have done shrooms two days in a row. When I'm on a shroom trip, my dopamine is off the charts. But the tradeoff is that I feel pretty low over the next few days.  


Same with weed. Yeah, you certainly can (and I have) spend the whole day stoned. But it just doesn't do much past a certain point. The first hit of the day and a few after that will get you there. Any subsequent hits will just make you numb. 

  
I also lose appetite on shrooms and gain appetite on weed (These should make a video game of this + 5 appetite after THC consumption), so I guess eating and drinking would depend on what you're consuming.   


Eventually you'll either feel numb, or like shit, becuase the lack of proper food or water will have your stomach churning acid and fucking you up.

5182,What would you have done as Joel in The Last of Us?,"\*SPOILERS FOR THE LAST OF US\*  
For those of you who have seen/played The Last of Us, would you be able to do what Joel did for Ellie in the final episode? Skip the following paragraph if you are familiar with the plot.  
If you don’t know, basically, there’s a zombie apocalypse and there's this man named Joel and this little girl named Ellie. Their relationship is complicated, but the gist is that they're like father and daughter and deeply love and care about one another. Ellie has an immunity to the fungus that is turning everyone into zombies, which makes her very interesting to medical professionals trying to cure the fungus and stop the pandemic. Joel is essentially tricked into bringing Ellie to a hospital for her brain to be harvested and possibly cure the fungus, potentially saving millions of lives and saving the world. His intense love for his daughter takes over him, and he massacres the entire hospital, hundreds, maybe thousands, idk, of innocent lives and sabotages any possibility of a cure for the fungus that has destroyed their planet in order to save her. When they're safe in the aftermath, he never tells her he did this. I always thought this was an emotionally charged and illogical course of action, but the more that I think about it, I really don't know what I'd do.

I asked my own dad, who is a doctor, if he'd do that to save me. I expected him to tell me how dearly he loves me and how he'd do anything for me, but he could not end hundreds of lives to save me, especially given the possibility that my own sacrifice could literally save the WORLD. At least, that was my way of thinking before he answered. Instead, without any hesitation, he said absolutely. He also said he probably would not tell me afterwards, just as Joel did. My dad is a very nonviolent and rational guy, so it made me reconsider my stance. For the parents, is love for one's child really so strong that it would cause one to make such a destructive decision without second thoughts? What would you do in Joel's place?

On a related note, would you be able to kill a loved one who had transformed into a zombie if it meant saving other lives including yours?

The goal isn't perfect health but getting it old enough to survive on solid food.

From what i could find out, cow's milk lacks the proper amounts of iron, vitamin C, and other nutrients that infants need, and the amounts of protein and some minerals can be too much for the kidneys.

- Five young boys accused Jackson of molesting them and he paid millions of dollars to three of their families to settle the lawsuits.

-  One of the boys was able to accuretly describe what Jackson's cock & balls looked like to the police.

- Its been well documented that Jackson liked sleeping in the same bed as young boys.

For the defence:

- Pedophilles always have a pattern of abuse. They don't just wake up one day and decide to molest children. Jackson had friendships with dozens of young people over his life and only five have accused him of sexually abusing them.

- Corey Feldman was friends with Micheal when he was a kid but he says he didn't get abused by him, even though he's accused other people of doing so, so he's hardly got a reason to lie.

- Ditto Macauly Culkin, although both he and Corey both said that Micheal had unhealthy relationships with children, but only in the sense that he'd make them emotionally dependent on him and then abandon them.

- None of his children have said they were abused by him, and pedophilles are more likely to abuse their own children than others.",499

I think I would call 911 while wrapping my shirt on my hand and attempting to break a window with it (not the one on the babies side). If I break the window open I'd try to knock any leftover glass out of the window (so the hypothetical baby and I don't cut ourselves), jump in the car, grab the baby, and run into the nearest store with AC in it. If It had ice or even food from a freezer I would put the baby on it while trying to see if it's alive. The stuff would still be packaged because putting ice directly on the baby might be too much for them. I'm not sure if doing that would cause more damage to the baby because of the sudden temperature change. I'm not sure how to preform baby cpr but I'd probably give it a try. I have no idea if baby cpr would even help in this situation. Either way I'd stay on line with 911 and do whatever they ask until an ambulance gets there. In my head that's my ideal reaction but it still feels like it wouldn't be enough especially if this hypothetical baby is having a severe heat stoke or something.

The head would definitely explode. It doesn't matter which angle they hit the ground. Once the head hits, it will blow up. Every bone in the body will break in some way. 

At first you may see some twitching and misinterpret it as the person still being alive, but this is a very normal occurrence in deaths where severe head trauma occurs. They may even make some absurd vocal gurgling noises coming directly from their exposed throat. 

As their body lay there, you will watch it quickly flatten out as the support from their skeleton is gone, their muscles are flattened and torn as well. They will look very pancakey. Their limbs will be twisted in insane ways. Something that frequently occurs is the roundish bones in the body explode, as the head does, subsequently detaching whatever was connected to them. So you may get to see some full on dismemberment. Or at the very least, detachment while the skin does its best to keep hold of the arms below the elbow, and legs below the knee. Shoes will definitely fly off, 100%. Their feet will look completely ridiculous as the heals are shattered and gone, the legs bent & twisted. Everything about them will be bent, twisted, and flat... except for the head. The head will be pretty much gone 🤣 

I've seen videos where pants fly off as well! Lots of crazy stuff happens when someone hits something at high velocity. It takes around 12 seconds for a human to reach terminal velocity, about 1,500 feet.

Can the gas outright kill you itself or is it actually suffocation which finishes you off?  


I was also confused because I looked at some previous posts on this subreddit and they referred to Mustard Gas as being ammonia and chloride (bleach). From my research Mustard Gas is made from sulfur and ethylene, meaning its made from alkaline as opposed to acid, and can be counteracted with acids like chlorine and sodium.

Victims are at higher risk for various complications and diseases, especially cancer, so it might take several decades to kill you.

Bought up a good point I’d never thought of, especially given hundreds of children are going to their doorstep, not to mention sometimes these kids can be PUSHY let alone for someone with those urges.

I do know that sex offenders here in the US aren’t allowed to have trick or treaters and need all lights outside off. Generally here if all lights are off it means no candy. Besides in the US sex offenders aren’t allowed to live near schools. So the amount of children they’d get at their door wouldn’t be too much.",4
5256,What does it feel like to fall from a great height?,Does it feel like a long time? Can you make sense of what's going on? Do you pass out? Do you have any memory of it?

On impact at first you feel nothing at first but after a few seconds you will feel pain of ripped muscles or broken bones depending on how you landed and if you damaged your spine then you feel nothing at all in some cases depending on the location of the spine damaged occurs.

Some pass out from shock and some don’t.

If you land on your head hard then it’s likely you will be blacked out and have heavy memory loss for about 1/2 days or longer if you are in a comatose state, again it all depends on the severity of the damage and height and how you land so it’s a mixed bag from person to person.

- example, one time my mother had a seizure and fell from the house steps leaving the house and she knocked her head pretty badly so the point she returned to a child like state for 48 hours, eventually she returned to her normal behaviour give or take but she definitely had long term memory recall problems for long term after.",24

I participate in several ""extreme"" sports so large scabs are the norm for me. Whenever I get a new fairly deep specimen I know it is going to only be a few days until it is crusted over enough to peel up properly. As soon as I can get a corner of it up I like to work at peeling the perimeter until the fleshy piece of scab separates enough to tear it off. Usually this process is pretty painful and it draws a bit of blood, but the pain feels good and I look forward to it.

Humans have about 162 psi bite force, it takes about 475 psi to break a finger. The strongest dog bite in the world is around 650 psi, both bears and snapping turtles can be over 1000 psi. Saltwater crocodiles apparently have the highest bite force at about 3700 psi. 

Our teeth are also pretty lame as far as omnivore teeth go. They look more like herbivore teeth, like a horse. Our teeth don’t look like bears or dogs, which are actually omnivores and they definitely don’t look like carnivore teeth, like cats and ferrets. Humans teeth aren’t puncturing anywhere deep enough to hang on, much less tear a finger off with our laughable bite force. 

I have no idea what area of the brain is responsible for “hey we have 10 fingers that’s a nice round number we’ll keep it that way.” Some sort of early lizard brain self preservation if I had to guess.

My tolerance is moderate but started moderate and mostly stayed there. Like I kind of plateau early where I can keep taking shit but it doesn’t feel different. I was drinking alcohol basically since I was born bc my mom would give it to me to get me to stop crying or leave her alone. I started drinking for real when I was 8 and I could take 3oz vodka in one shot and still do cartwheels. When I was 12 I could take ketamine or percs and still take my math test.

5276,"Is it ethical to tell terminally ill children that if/when they die, they will go to Heaven?","Was watching some medical footage, and came across a family with a terminally ill 4-year-old whose condition would likely not respond to further treatment. They gave her a choice: the next time she gets sick, she can either go to the hospital to try to get treatment, or she can “stay at home and go to Heaven.” They explained that in Heaven, she wouldn’t have to use her wheelchair, and she would feel completely healthy. They said that they would meet her in Heaven later. She ended up deciding to “stay home to go to Heaven.” Her choice was informed by an understanding that Heaven was something that would *absolutely exist*, and that *she would no longer be ill when she went there.*

I’m interested in how this relates to informed consent. Young children cannot yet fully understand life, death, and the possibility of an afterlife. An older patient given the same choice may choose differently due to an increased understanding of the world and developing their own beliefs surrounding death and the afterlife.

What do rapist anticipate will happen to them, or their relationship with the victim, once they’ve committed a rape?

so around 1865-1877 was the period of reconstruction, which meant african americans were regaining their civil rights back, but that only meant more discrimination and violence against them because whites were afraid of competition from recently freed black slaves, whose freedom made a huge tilt to the agricultural economy.

news outlets at the time, im pretty sure they made every crime a black person were to commit a big deal and sensationalize it to generate public outcry.

tldr; most if not all lynching victims during this period were black people and the white guys didnt quite like that they were free

I do not want to be taken as some random thing in the street people can just toy with for pleasure especially from some pathetic drug addict high schoolers. I didn't feel intimidated by any of them, they're my size give or take, but they were in a group and I know they had weapons on them (at least they threatened other kids with them) so getting confrontational in such a forward way would be trouble.  
I made full eye contact trying to stare them down and communicate that nothing about them gave me reason to feel fear and if they tried to really get up in my space I'd be ready to get violent for my physical space being violated (and I do carry a knife that I'd be ready to use in response to that situation). I stared at them directly till they were far off, they noticed this. Now I see these freaks out and about occasionally and I'm just wondering how people like this might take someone who stared them down. Am I asking for potential more serious trouble down the line because I won't bend over and be intimidated or react angrily like they want, or do they understand they won't get a reaction they want like lashing back unless they actually get my face and try to threaten me, giving opportunity for self defense and use the law against them so they won't bother and would rather go find some other target to harass?

I would also guess that one does not here about successful assassination via poison all that often because it is probably a rather unreliable way.

Edit: Noticed I misread the question. Since the amount of alcohol is the same it will have pretty much the same effect. The higher concentration leads to a faster onset of the effect initially though. Since the transfer of substances in the body is not really a guided process like someone who is sorting stuff on a conveyor but more like a bunch of packages floating around till they randomly arrive at a shelf that accepts them the larger number of alcohol packages leads to the likelihood of a package getting to an alcohol shelf being higher.

5341,Intrusive Thoughts - Do you get them?,"Really fucked up and disturbing, usually gross, intrusive thoughts are something I deal with somewhat regularly and I'm just wondering if I'm just screwed up in the head and the only one or if this is a regular thing for people. 

An example of an intrusive thought I'll commonly have is walking past a pile of shit on the sidewalk or something, and my mind goes 'what if you just took a bite out of that'. 

It disturbs me and makes me wonder if it's just brain being brain or a subconscious reflection of some sort of deeper fascination. I'm hoping, for my sake, it's the former.  
So anyways, tell me if you get intrusive thoughts, what they're like, and your explanation for them.

5344,How would it look to die from being shot in the temple?,"Title. So I'm writing a story, and a character dies this way. I think this would be the best place to ask this question. Here is the excerpt.

""Cane, it isn't like that. That special feeling that Arnica told me about..."" She pulls something from behind her back. Cane cranes his neck to the side in order to see what it was, but his question would be answered soon enough.

""It's lovely isn't it? That I finally found ou-"" *Bang!*

The sound washed the field in noise like the sound of Zeus's ire. Fireflies welled up from a small tunnel sitting away from eyeshot and a medium sized hole appeared in her temple, with the secondary 'cough' of the firearm soaring out of hearing distance off into the nighttime air. A wedding band rolled past Cane's sitting form.

It wasn't like in the movies. No stumbling, going silent before finally moving to the ground, or letting out one last word before falling asleep. She didn't look like she was sleeping. She just looked dead. Instant loss of muscle function with a short exhale, not one unlike the ending of a healthy yawn. No twitching, either.

As someone who's heard that sound before, Cane knew exactly what it was. The words of his old friend, a weapons geek, emerged from the black sea of shock that was taking the place of higher thinking at that moment.

""A subcompact version of the AKM platform, chambered in the same iconic 7.62x39 millimeter that you're so familiar with and made of blood-infused steel! You can shoot as many Aergon Venom rounds as you want! Small enough to be concealed on one person, too! What about this doesn't satisfy you?""

A familiar cadence broke the deathly silence.

""It didn't *have* to be like this, Cane. I didn't *want* it to be like this. But this is what it took to show you what you've done wrong. The thing about saving people is that it doesn't matter how you feel. Emotions come and go, go... And come back. Don't let lives depend on--"" A sob broke through his speech after he failed to throttle it. ""I can't do this anymore. You took away my brother, my dad, and now..."" The owner of the voice sighed, a motor and two rusted accordions creaking inside of his chassis with two yellow-sclera-having orbs facing your organic ones. He didn't even look human now, compared to the last time Cane seen him.

A single tear fell and the pencil that wrote the ninth symphony was dropped and shattered. The climax was thick in the air.

""Under This hallowed moon I call upon the holy guidance of Deya'Loah's flaming Excalibur; its irascibility. Only one of us..."" He choked a single time. ""Will see the end of this night. I, Adamn Dreksehn, Son of Ketsækhe Loah and... The crime of defilement... ask you, Cane Castor, for a duel in front of our god.""

&#x200B;

I think I added too much.

Context: Cane, the main character, ran away from his school made to create elite soldiers because he didn't like it. A kid called Adamn who Cane saw falling behind and decided to help train after his own schooling took over his spot as the new ""high-promise student,"" and for Adamn's trial to graduate, he needed to hunt Cane down and bring him back, dead or alive. He killed that girl to further hammer in the ""that's what you get"" message.

Aergons are genetically modified humans. The full explanation would take hours. To sum it up, though, Aergon Venom is one of the ways to get around their regeneration. It's a mix of an acid and a powerful psychedelic, which can corrode barrels with careless use.

Deya'Loah is the god of a certain religion in the story. Dueling is still a thing thanks to the text related to this faith. It translates roughly to ""Glass Deity.""",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x38eb45190>,1692935440.0,kinda cringe,2
5345,Is raw human meat safe?,"Finally a place I can ask this without being seen as crazy 😂. 

So you know how raw chicken meat is very bad for you and can make you sick, but you can eat steak pretty much raw as long as the outside is cooked? Well I was wondering if human meat is safe to eat raw? I’m obviously not going to eat it but my morbid curiosity is too strong not to ask.",morbidquestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x38ec46910>,1692886383.0,"Out of all the instances I know of raw human meat consumption there has been no health issues recording due to eating specifically raw human meat alone. The majority of issues that come with anthropophagy are normally not caused by anthropophagy and are instead caused by the same thing that caused someone to eat another human (instances of anthropophagy where it happens as a necessity due to lack of food) or in the cases of prion diseases- which in humans who eat humans kuru is contracted by eating a human brain and prion diseases are not impacted by cooking the food. 

Being said there isn't that much put into studying human consumption of raw human meat, and we do not have the best records of historic anthropophagy in relation to impacts of raw human meat either. With better documented cases there's also other things that may provide an impact, for instance the plane crash in the Andes had frozen bodies- that's going to be different than bodies stored in non freezing conditions. They also ate it dried but I'm not sure just how well the drying process would have really worked. So I would suggest cooking it.",6

>Type III (infibulation or pharaonic circumcision), the ""sewn closed"" category, is the removal of the external genitalia and fusion of the wound. The inner and/or outer labia are cut away, with or without removal of the clitoral glans. Type III is found largely in northeast Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan (although not in South Sudan). According to one 2008 estimate, over eight million women in Africa are living with Type III FGM. According to UNFPA in 2010, 20 percent of women with FGM have been infibulated. In Somalia, according to Edna Adan Ismail, the child squats on a stool or mat while adults pull her legs open; a local anaesthetic is applied if available.

>The amputated parts might be placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3 mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with surgical thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs, and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining hole is too large in the view of the girl's family, the procedure is repeated.

>The vagina is opened for sexual intercourse, for the first time either by a midwife with a knife or by the woman's husband with his penis. In some areas, including Somaliland, female relatives of the bride and groom might watch the opening of the vagina to check that the girl is a virgin. The woman is opened further for childbirth (defibulation or deinfibulation), and closed again afterwards (reinfibulation). Reinfibulation can involve cutting the vagina again to restore the pinhole size of the first infibulation. This might be performed before marriage, and after childbirth, divorce and widowhood.

Underweight people don't seem to get made fun of as much and are sometimes seen as more attractive. It can be easier to hide too.

But if you're fat? Good luck hiding it and I hope you like being constantly made fun of and ignored by people because of your weight.

Of course, I'm striving to reach a healthy weight. But if I had to really pick one or the other, I'd probably pick underweight.

When it comes to access and interaction with people though I'd rather be underweight.

You can sit in public seats better, towels fit on you better, I find people tend to make less assumptions about your character too.",54
