0,My husband hasn’t spoken to me in a week. How do I handle the silent treatment?,"Ok…I’m NOT a typical redditor…I’m an old married lady.  Your husband is a man baby.  He’s forcing you into apologizing.  You don’t owe  him anything.  Personally I’d take his silence as a blessing and use the opportunity to just text him things to do.

Do not let him manipulate you into apologizing for his shitty behavior.  You’re just rewarding and reinforcing his tantrum.  You’re a mother, you’d not tolerate this in your children.

Yes it is sad you have to treat him as a child but he chose to act like one.","It can be difficult to handle the silent treatment from your husband, especially if you don’t know why he’s giving it to you. The best thing to do in this situation is to try to talk to him calmly and openly about what is going on. Ask him why he is giving you the silent treatment and try to listen to what he has to say without getting defensive. It may also be helpful to apologize for anything you may have done that could have caused the rift between you two. If he is still not willing to talk, it may be best to seek counseling or advice from a third-party to help you both work through your issues."

16,"Why is it people can go their whole lives doing good towards other people, being completely selfless and helping thousands of not millions of others along their journey, do one wrong thing, and suddenly everyone thinks they're ""showing their true colors""?","Depends on how bad the one thing is. Also plenty of monsterous people do stuff like work with charities, donate money, etc just for the clout and good public image so that they will be less suspected or be judged less harshly.","People often make snap judgments and are quick to decide that a single wrong action defines a person's character.

A 22 year old will be focusing on starting a career, having already graduated college. They've likely lived on their own for a while, will be planning for the future.

When you pull it out, the metal part for one side can touch the connector for the other side.","This is because the plug on your headphones is not fully inserted into the headphone jack.

There is nothing stopping the majority of able bodied people leaving the house and contributing to society and speaking with others.

The internet does a world of good to make it easy for people to find places to go and things to do, including how to improve their situation

Introversion or extroversion aren’t justification for maladapted sociability, they’re a scape goat label people with separate issues use to defend their inaction or poor actions

At the end of the day it’s your job as an individual to pursue the life you want.

There are of course a plethora of contributing factors to peoples agency and ability to do what they want to do - which I don’t deny - but the relatively simple processes that improve peoples situation remain the same, even if it’s harder for some people than others","Yes, many studies point to a growing loneliness epidemic.

35,How can I find out someones pronouns?,"So spoiler alert: there's no reason to use someone's pronouns when you're talking \_to\_ them. Gendered pronouns only come into play in the third person, i.e. when you're talking \_about\_ someone. Typically the moment you use the wrong pronouns you're talking to someone else, who, if they know, will correct you. No harm done.

I really don't understand why people have such a problem with this. 99% of time pronouns will be what you think they are. The rest of the time, in my personal experience at least, people are pretty good at dropping enough hints into a conversation for you to figure it out - just like single vs married, you don't just outright ask someone, you give them enough room in the conversation to tell you. Really basic interpersonal interaction stuff.","The best way to find out someone's pronouns is to directly ask them. If you feel comfortable, you can introduce yourself and your pronouns before asking what pronouns they use. If you don't feel comfortable asking directly, you can look for clues such as their name, their social media presence, or the way they dress."

119,What do I do?,"As a former landlord, I would prefer you call and let me know. The potential damage is more of a concern than being bothered on a Saturday. When I got there I would have to see what you have done in order to decide whether to charge you or not.
That being said is it an old toilet? Are you able to get the line started but just not tight enough to stop the leak?","The first step is to identify what the problem is and why it is happening. Once you have identified the problem, think about what you can do to solve it. Consider what resources you have available to you and what actions you can take that will make a difference. Seek advice from trusted sources and research potential solutions. If possible, create a plan of action and set achievable goals. Finally, take action and follow through on the plan."
120,Cotton Buds,The not for cleaning ears is probably one of the most broken rules of all time,"Cotton buds are small sticks with one or both ends covered in cotton wool. They are used for cleaning and applying cosmetics, and for cleaning small objects such as jewellery and baby's ears. Cotton buds are sometimes referred to as Q-tips, a trademarked name."
121,Gamers: why is there so much hate towards Starfield?,"The game isn't what people wanted/expected it to be. They wanted a massive universe for space exploration, charting new planets, ect.

The game ended up being ""Fallout in space"". All of the planets are randomly generated based on the same few ""seeds"", you can't just land on a planet wherever you want, it's all locked behind loading screens, ect.

It's not that it's a bad game; people who went into it with realistic expectations are enjoying it plenty. People just wanted ""Star Citizen, but complete"". But this game was never going to be that.","There is a lot of speculation and unknowns with the game Starfield, and with any unknown, people can become anxious and frustrated. Some people may also be worried that Starfield will be too similar to other games or may not live up to the hype. Additionally, Bethesda (the game's developer) has been known to have technical issues with their games, so some people may be worried that Starfield will suffer from the same issues."
122,Why are there conspiracy theories that 9/11 was an inside job?,"There's zero truth in the conspiracy theories. I'll debunk the most common one. 

Jet fuel melted the steel beams. 

Jet fuel wasn't the sole cause of the beams failing. First off you have a jet crashing into a building at a relatively high velocity. This causes fractures in the steel throughout a good chunk of the building's substructure including the load bearing sections. As the fire rages the substructure begins to develop gaps that get bigger and also reduce the stability of the building. As the substructure fails the building is more and more reliant on the fractured load bearing sections of the buildings. Eventually the load becomes to much for the fractured load bearing sections and once that happens the building will pancake exactly like what we saw happen.","There are many conspiracy theories surrounding the events of 9/11 that suggest it was an inside job. The theories suggest that the US government had prior knowledge of the attacks and allowed them to happen or even orchestrated them. These theories are often based on perceived discrepancies in the official narrative, such as the collapse of the Twin Towers, the lack of military response, and the destruction of evidence. Such theories have been widely debunked by experts, but they continue to persist due to various psychological, political, and cultural factors."
123,Can you legally break out of a building if you’re mistakenly locked in?,It's unlawful to have a place of business that people inside can't exit freely during opening hours.  There should already be a keyless way out of that gym in an emergency.,"No, it would be considered criminal trespass and breaking and entering. If you are mistakenly locked in a building, you should contact the building owner or the police."
124,"Americans, help a third worlder understand one aspect of the tipping issue?","In America incomes are very high, and eating out is a very common form of luxury spending. It would be much cheaper to buy groceries and make food at home, but there are many people so accustomed to eating out that they'll say they ""can't cook."" There's no cultural stigma against cooking (in fact it's usually seen as an attractive trait), but people resent the idea that they would be forced to do it because of their financial circumstances.

There is some difference between regions in that there are more restaurants closeby in urban areas, and in rural areas you might not even be able to get food delivered. For most people though, whether urban or suburban, it's very common to drive to restaurants or get drive-through good, since car usage is so high.

> How expensive are groceries in the US, proportionally speaking? Once you factor in money, fuel, gas/electricity and the time it takes to buy and prepare food, do the dishes, etc., does it just not make financial sense to eat at home?

It's easily much cheaper to buy food at home. Grocery costs are much smaller parts of the household budget than they used to be, but it's often still people's biggest expense after housing, utilities, transportation. Some areas are known for food being very expensive compared to the rest of the country, especially Hawaii and Alaska.

> Where are the grannies? I'm a South American of East European descent, there's always some granny nearby trying to literally feed me to death, so what's the deal up there? Are you shipping them off to the Caribbean? Are all the food trucks owned by grannies?

Americans move around a lot and often far away from family, only visiting for holidays. Although this differs a bit by area and culture, it's also not that common for grandparents to live with the rest of the family. So while this stereotype certainly exists in the U.S., most people don't have a granny to cook for them.

> And last but not least: could it be that what I'm seeing is a correlation between overly online people and people who eat outside of the house?

This is definitely true. Reddit skews young and wealthy compared to the rest of the U.S.","Tipping is a way of expressing gratitude towards someone who provided you with a service. In the United States, it is customary to tip people who provide services such as waiters, baristas, taxi drivers, hairdressers, and other service providers. This is because many of these service providers rely on tips as part of their income. Tipping is seen as an important way to show appreciation for the service they provided, and to help them make a living."

126,How much hair do you actually lose everyday?,"Hi /u/KPoppa1020,

We noticed you are a pretty new Reddit account, so we just wanted to let you know to check out the subreddit rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/rules) and maybe have a read through our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/wiki/index/faq) - they make for fascinating reading!

We're called No Stupid Questions because we believe nobody needs to be attacked for asking a question, but *that doesn't mean there are no rules!* This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions. Please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions - that's not in the spirit of this sub. While you *can* ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and offensive questions elsewhere to give people a good experience here - and if you have a medical question, please ask your doctor, not us. 
    
Otherwise, welcome!

127,Is it better to not laugh after telling a joke? Or even when explaining or brainstorming something that’s funny? Does not laughing actually give others the opportunity to laugh more?,"Comedians that are on stage and laugh at their own jokes as they tell them look fake AF to me.  Like we know you have told this joke 100 times, is this really cracking you up right now bro?  I just don’t buy it, so it makes. Then look cheap- like they are acting, and doing a shot job of it.

I’d prefer the comedian telling the joke to only laugh on stage if it’s real, natural and something outside of their routine organically made them laugh - otherwise, it’s very annoying.","It depends on the situation. If you are telling a joke, it is probably best to laugh after telling it, as this can help cue others to laugh as well. If you are explaining or brainstorming something humorous, it may be better to not laugh, as this can give others the opportunity to laugh instead. Ultimately, it is up to the individual and depends on the context of the situation."
128,Why isnt Chris Smoove uploading NBA news??,"Oh, you're right. I just realized he hasn't uploaded anything NBA news recently which is strange. I'm not sure why.","Chris Smoove is currently focused on creating content for his YouTube channel. He may be planning to create content related to NBA news in the future, but nothing has been announced yet."
129,Why is it not possible to output via headphones and internal speakers simultaneously on most devices?,"Most people want one or the other. The audio amp circuit is much simpler (thus cheaper) if it only has to drive one or the other. They can put a simple attenuator in line with the headphone to cut the volume to a safe level and leave everything else about the volume controls the same. If they want to let you do both they often need two different different audio amps, one for the speaker and one for the headphone. You will find this in better audio equipment and the headphone will typically be marked as “monitor”. The intent is usually to allow someone at the device to listen to the audio while the speakers are connected remotely. For small devices like a hand held radio, there just isn’t much of a use case to enable both so why incur the cost of components to allow both.","Most devices are not designed to output audio through two separate audio outputs at the same time. This is because the audio signals are usually sent through a single amplifier, and the amplifier can only output the audio signal to one device at a time. Additionally, the audio output from the headphones and the internal speakers may conflict with each other, creating a distorted or unpleasant sound."
130,"We have COVID at-home tests, why don’t we have Strep Throat at-home tests, or other illness tests?","Generally too expensive to be worth it, and there isn't much value in having such tests.","At-home tests for illnesses such as strep throat are currently not widely available. This is because many illnesses, such as strep throat, require a lab test to diagnose. Additionally, at-home tests for illnesses such as strep throat can be difficult and costly to produce. The accuracy of at-home tests also needs to be taken into account, and at-home tests may not always be able to provide reliable results. Finally, some illnesses, such as strep throat, require a doctor to prescribe antibiotics, and a doctor's visit may be necessary to properly diagnose the illness."
131,Will I get diabetes if I drink soda all day?,"Maybe.  But overall, drinking sugary soda is not a healthy approach to weight gain, unless you're starving on a desert island with a only a cache of soft drinks.","Drinking soda all day can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Sodas are high in sugar, which can lead to weight gain, and being overweight is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Additionally, sodas contain artificial sweeteners, which have been linked to an increased risk of diabetes. Therefore, drinking soda all day can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes."
132,Which got more news coverage yesterday (September 15) the Hollywood strike or the auto workers strike?,"Neither got much coverage at all.

There hasn't been to much to new to report on either.",The auto workers strike got more news coverage on September 15.
133,How do gendered languages deal with non binary people etc.?,"Linguistic gender and personal gender are different things.

For example ""madchen"" is the German for ""girl"", but it uses the neuter gender article ""das"".","Gendered languages can be quite difficult to navigate for those who do not identify as either male or female. Many languages do not have a gender-neutral pronoun or an easy way to refer to someone who is non-binary. However, some languages are beginning to create gender-neutral terms to address this issue. For example, some languages have adopted the gender-neutral pronoun ""ze"" or ""hir"". Additionally, some languages have adopted the use of gender-neutral terms such as ""partner"" or ""spouse"" to refer to someone who is non-binary. In some cases, languages have even adopted new gender-neutral pronouns such as ""xe"" or ""they."" As more languages become aware of the need for gender-neutral terms, more solutions are being developed."
134,why guys often wear same few clothes ?,Simplicity. Most men don’t really care to wear or own too much in terms of fashion. But you’ll find the anomalies who know how to dress.,"There are a few reasons why guys may often wear the same few clothes. One of the most common is that they may have a limited budget, so they purchase items that are affordable and can be worn multiple times. Another reason is that they may simply not have the time to shop for new clothes or may not be interested in fashion. Additionally, some guys may prefer the comfort and convenience of wearing the same few items over and over."
135,Why do people hate climate change protesters? I mean aren’t they doing a good thing like spreading message to save earth?,"People think the message is a lie.
So when you fuck someone's day or event up , they tend to get a bit annoyed.

Think of it as if a Religious zealot glued themselves to your car to ""prove that ""Sid the God"" was real.

Would that annoy you?","People may hate climate change protesters because they feel the protesters are not doing enough to take direct action to combat climate change. They may also feel that the protesters are not offering any real solutions or are not being realistic about the scope of the problem. Additionally, some people may feel that the protesters are making the issue too political or are not considering the economic impact of proposed solutions. Finally, some people may simply disagree with the protesters' message or feel that the protesters are not doing enough to make a difference."

Maybe you can only see 1 inch in front of you without glasses.","No, wearing corrective lenses for near-sightedness will not damage your vision further.

As for asking out a lesbian. Imagine if you hadn't, then you'd always be left wondering. It didn't turn out how you wanted but that's just how it is.","Talking to girls and asking them out can be intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. The best way to start is by making conversation and getting to know the girl. Ask her questions about her interests and hobbies and be sure to listen and show genuine interest.

Leaks can occur from faulty plumbing, worn out seals, or even from a sink that has been left running.

You could set up your own connection in a different country, but that leads to the same answer, a VPN.","Yes, using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is an effective way to change the country of origin when connecting to a site. A VPN encrypts all of your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server located in the country of your choice. This allows you to browse the web as if you were physically located in that country, providing access to websites and services that may be blocked or restricted in your current location."
159,Is it still considered BDD if I am actually ugly and multiple people have pointed it out?,Like dysphoria?,"No, BDD is a mental health disorder that involves a preoccupation with one's physical appearance that is not based on reality.

161,Can I upgrade my brain my transplanting the brain of my dead twin brother?,"No.

First of all, we just don't have the level of technology needed for a successful brain transplant.

If you somehow transplanted your dead twin brother's brain into your body, you would be killing yourself and giving him a new body.","No, you cannot upgrade your brain by transplanting the brain of your dead twin brother. Brain transplantation is currently not possible due to the complexity of the human brain and the lack of technology to successfully transfer the memories and identity of one individual to another."
162,Thick thighs save lives,"Naw its a good thing, im not saying having skinny legs is a bad thing either, but this is a good thing.","Thick thighs are a sign of strength and resilience, and they can help people of all sizes and shapes lead healthier, more active lives. Thick thighs can provide the support needed for running, jumping, and other activities that require strong leg muscles. They can also help to reduce the risk of injury, as thick thighs provide more cushioning than thinner thighs.

Yes, I do listen to classical music. I'm currently enjoying listening to works by Beethoven, Mozart, and Brahms."
164,Can you prosecute the hospital if someone commit suicide in the psychiatry section?,"I don’t think prosecute is the correct term that would be if it was a criminal issue which I think is highly unlikely. 

It is more likely civil issue, that you could sue for.","No, you cannot prosecute the hospital for suicide committed in the psychiatry section. Suicide is not a criminal act, and a hospital cannot be held liable for the actions of a patient."

You want to consume it as fast as possible in order to achieve the highest possible concentration for the greatest effect. This is the same reason people do drugs all at once and you dont see anyone micro dosing their cocaine throughout the day or smoking 1/8th of a cigarette every 30 minutes.","Yes, the speed at which you drink your coffee can affect how the caffeine affects you.

197,Is mulching your lawn clippings messy?,"Depends on how sharp your blades are, how high your blades are set, and how high the grass is. 

I usually bag the first 1 or 2 mows of the season because there are a lot of dead leaves and some garbage left over from the previous fall/winter. But I mulch the rest of the year. In my area in the Midwest, that means mowing every 2-3 days in the spring, but much less when things dry out in the summer. 

If you let the grass get too high and/or you have your blades set too low, then you can have a mess of clippings left over that are both ugly and not that great for the lawn. 

But if you do it regularly, then it’s not only a lot easier than bagging, you won’t even notice the clippings.","Mulching your lawn clippings can be slightly messy, depending on the size of the clippings. Smaller clippings can be quite fine and easily spread around, while larger clippings can be harder to work with."
198,How do i stop being a wuss?,"If it makes you feel any better, I think it’s a good thing that you aren’t desensitized to violence, because too many people are.

She’s also the sweetest person I know and is healing a lot of generational trauma for our family.  But I understand why this might be frustrating for you.

I would speak to a therapist about this, personally. Especially about ways of healthy communication without being afraid of confrontation. Mine told me something that really changed the way I think about that… as long as I’m communicating a healthy boundary in a respectful way, I should not be afraid of confrontation. How they react is on THEM, not me. As in, if they can’t handle their emotions and react poorly, that’s something they need to work on themselves. 

I don’t want to say “exposure therapy” for the violence in media because I’m not a therapist, and that doesn’t always work. Sorry, I don’t think this was very helpful 😂","1. Set goals and take action: It's easy to be a wuss when you're not doing anything to challenge yourself. Set small goals that you can achieve and take action towards achieving them.

2. Face your fears: Identify what's holding you back and make an effort to face those fears head-on.

3. Build your confidence: Confidence is key to success. Work on building your confidence through positive affirmations, learning new skills, and taking on new challenges.

4. Challenge yourself: Push yourself outside of your comfort zone and take on new challenges. This will help you build your confidence and resilience.
