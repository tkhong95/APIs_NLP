0,"People who haven't pooped in 2019 yet, why are you still holding on to last years shit?",It's all I have,"That's a good question! It's likely that a person is still holding onto last year's 'shit' due to some sort of constipation issue. Constipation can be caused by a variety of things, such as diet, stress, or medications. It's important to talk to your doctor if you are having difficulty with pooping, as there may be a medical reason for it."
1,"Would you watch a show where a billionaire CEO has to go an entire month on their lowest paid employees salary, without access to any other resources than that of the employee? What do you think would happen?","3 months minimum and I'd watch it

Thanks for the gold!!","Yes, I would watch a show like that. I think it would be a great way for the billionaire CEO to gain insight into the daily lives of their employees and understand the challenges they face. It could also be an opportunity for the CEO to improve their own work-life balance and appreciate the value of their employees. I think the CEO would learn a lot about how their decisions affect their employees, and it could be an eye-opening experience for both parties."
2,"What if God came down one day and said ""It's pronounced 'Jod' then left?","“I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it’s a stupid-ass decision, I’ve elected to ignore it.”","If God came down one day and said ""It's pronounced 'Jod' then left, people would likely be in shock and confusion. They would likely spend a great deal of time trying to figure out what God meant and why He said it. Some people might even start to believe that God was trying to tell them something important about the way they should be living their lives."
3,"How would you feel about a feature where if someone upvotes a crosspost, the original post is upvoted automatically?",what about subs that crosspost from other subs to mock them?,"I think this feature could be beneficial in some cases, as it would encourage users to crosspost content and spread knowledge across multiple platforms. However, I'm also cognizant of the potential for abuse with such a feature, and I think it would be important to put safeguards in place to prevent users from maliciously upvoting their own content or using the feature in a spammy manner."
4,"How would you feel about a ""if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,"" button for Reddit?","Found this after accidentally losing my place and starting at the top. Give me my place back, Reddit!",I think it would be a great addition to Reddit. It would be very helpful for users who accidentally scroll to the top and are unable to find their way back to the content they were previously viewing. It could also help to reduce frustration and time spent trying to find their way back to the content.
5,Stan Lee has passed away at 95 years old,"Was really hoping he'd get to see Avengers 4, but at least he did get to see and interact with his creations on the big screen.

RIP.

",". Lee was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He was best known as the creator of Marvel Comics, and was responsible for the creation of iconic characters such as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, and the X-Men.

He was also a philanthropist, and championed numerous charitable causes. Lee will be remembered as a true innovator and a legend in the world of comics."
6,"Reddit, how would you feel about a law that bans radio stations from playing commercials with honking/beeping/siren noises in them?","I would feel like ""finally. Lawmakers taking the public's issues to heart.""","I would be in favor of a law that bans radio stations from playing commercials with honking/beeping/siren noises in them. It can be very annoying and distracting for listeners. Plus, it can give a false sense of urgency that isn't necessary."
7,"Bill Gates said, ""I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it."" What's a real-life example of this?","I knew a guy who had a low level data/reporting job. He had several daily/weekly work responsibilities, including a bunch of reports that needed quite a bit of tweaking from raw data to finished product. But like I said, low level.

We didn't find out until way later, but he had set up macros for each of his major responsibilities where he could. Once set up, he'd just run the macros to do his work, but then he'd (smartly) hold off on delivering the reports until just a little before the deadlines. 

He'd hit every assignment and was seen as reliable. He also would complain about the workload so people would leave him with that work. I doubt he did a full hour of work a day after he set up what he did.

Eventually he left the job for one with better pay. But damn did he work lazy. Also, he was smart not to reveal until the end, because had he told them about it he would have gotten a pat on the back and would have been given a whole other workload, on top of maintaining those macros/etc. Dude milked the job, not the other way around.","A real-life example of this is an engineer who was tasked with developing a new piece of software for a company. Instead of spending days writing new code from scratch, the engineer used existing code libraries to create a solution more quickly and efficiently."
8,"What if Earth is like one of those uncontacted tribes in South America, like the whole Galaxy knows we're here but they've agreed not to contact us until we figure it out for ourselves?","What if aliens showed up here millions of years ago, saw a planet inhabited buy enormous lizard monsters and said fuck that, dont come back to this place.","That is a very interesting possibility. It is likely that any advanced civilizations in the galaxy would have a strict policy of non-interference with less advanced civilizations, especially if the less advanced civilizations do not have the capacity to understand the consequences of contact. As such, it is possible that the galactic community has agreed to leave Earth alone until such a time as humanity is ready for contact. It is also possible that Earth is being monitored from a distance, so that when the time is right, contact could be initiated."
9,"Anthony Bourdain once said ""There's a guy in my head, and all he wants to do is lay in bed all day long, smoke pot, and watch old movies and cartoons. My life is a series of strategems, to avoid, and outwit that guy"". Who is ""that guy"" for you, and what do you do to avoid him?","We came to an agreement and take turns occupying the same body. It's me from 5:30 am  to 5pm on weekdays. And he gets evenings,  weekends and holidays.","That guy for me is my own inner critic. He's the voice that tells me I'm not good enough, not smart enough, and not capable enough. To avoid and outwit him, I try to focus on the positive aspects of my life and my abilities. I also try to remind myself that I am capable and worthy of success. I make sure to take breaks and practice self-care, as well as surround myself with positive people and encouraging words."
10,How is everyone enjoying Reddit while Instagram Facebook and whatsapp are all down?,I thought my wifi was stupid,"It's been an interesting experience! I think a lot of people are excited to explore Reddit since they don't have access to the other platforms. There's been a lot of discussion on the various subreddits about the outage, so it's been a great way to stay connected and informed. Additionally, people have been taking the opportunity to explore new subreddits and discover new topics and conversations."
11,It's more than likely that Covid-19 will still be around at Christmas time - how are we going to explain to kids that Santa is still allowed to go into millions of houses?,"He invented ""contactless delivery""","One way to explain to kids that Santa is still allowed to go into millions of houses despite the presence of Covid-19 is to emphasize the importance of safety protocols. Explain that in order to keep everyone safe, Santa is taking extra precautions, such as wearing a mask, washing his hands often, and making sure that he is socially distanced from others. Let them know that these safety protocols will help ensure that Santa can still come to their house and bring presents."

16,"[Serious] Americans, would you be in support of putting a law in place that government officials, such as senators and the president, go without pay during shutdowns like this while other federal employees do? Why, or why not?",I would prefer that Congress can't leave the Capitol until a budget is passed. ,"I would be in support of putting a law in place that government officials, such as senators and the president, go without pay during shutdowns like this while other federal employees do. I think it's important that those in positions of power feel the same effects of a shutdown as their constituents, so that they are more incentivized to work together to find a solution that works for everyone. Additionally, it would be a way for them to show solidarity with the federal employees who are also affected by the shutdown."
17,Iceland just announced that every Icelander over the age of 18 automatically become organ donors with ability to opt out. How do you feel about this?,"As long as the ability to opt out is easy and evident, I don't care.


Edit: Thanks for the upvotes everyone!!! I really did not expect my opinion to be appreciated by so many people.

I did read most of the comments and responded to some. It seems a lots of people can't think of a reason to opt out. The only answer I have to that is everyone has their own view on life and may have different views then the majority.","I think this is an admirable move by Iceland. It shows that they are committed to protecting the health and wellbeing of their citizens, and I believe it could have a positive impact on the lives of many people. I also appreciate that they are giving everyone the right to opt out if they don't want to participate. I think this is a great way to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to make a difference."

21,How would you feel about a law that requires people over the age of 70 to pass a specialized driving test in order to continue driving?,"That's a great idea. I'm going to call my 68 year old congressman and ask him to support such legislation.

Edit: Most driving laws are passed by state legislators, who usually do drive themselves.","I think such a law could be beneficial if it is based on the individual's driving ability and health. It could help ensure that elderly drivers are capable of safely operating a vehicle and reduce the risk of an accident. However, it should also take into account the individual's overall health and lifestyle, and allow them to be exempt from the test if they are able to demonstrate that they are able to safely drive."

24,"How would you feel if the only thing we knew about presidential candidates was their stance on issues...no information on party, name, gender, race, or religious beliefs (or lack thereof)?","Would it be based on their actual stance, or what they claim is their stance?","I think it would be refreshing to know a candidate's stance on issues without any preconceived notions about their party, name, gender, race, or religious beliefs. It would put the focus squarely on the issues and allow voters to make decisions based on the positions of the candidates rather than any other factors. It would also help to reduce the influence of identity politics, which can often lead to polarization and divisiveness."

26,"Police Officers of Reddit, what are you thinking when you see cases like George Floyd?",Horrified. When you have someone in custody you are responsible for their safety and well being.,I think about the countless other cases that never got the attention of the public or the media. I think about the countless other victims of police brutality who never got justice. I think about the families and friends of these victims who never saw justice. I think about how the system failed them and how it continues to fail so many others. I think about how much work we still have to do to make sure that these cases are no longer the norm. I also think about how I can be part of the solution and how I can help make sure that these cases are no longer the norm.

34,"How do you cope with being treated like you are crazy for following covid safety guidelines, when others around you aren’t doing the same?","It's like driving a car, and the other drivers aren't being safe. You keep your distance, try to stay positive, and try to understand that everyone has different levels of risk tolerance, understanding of the rules, etc. and that the best you can do is keep yourself safe and not contribute to the problem. Getting upset, or wanting to personally intervene to police other people's behavior is perfectly understandable, but it probably won't help, it might even make things worse.","It can be difficult to be treated like you are crazy for following Covid safety guidelines when others around you are not doing the same. It is important to remember that you are making a responsible and informed choice to protect yourself and others, and you should not feel ashamed of your decision. If you feel like the situation is becoming too uncomfortable, you can politely explain your reasons for following the guidelines and then excuse yourself from the conversation. You can also try to limit the amount of time you spend around people who do not follow the guidelines, and focus on spending more time with people who do.

Each individual should be allowed to serve as long as they are able and willing to do so.

It would also limit the representation of diverse viewpoints and experiences in the legislative and judicial branches of government."

I get to spend hours upon hours by myself and it’s a pretty good way to cheat on tests or steal money or whatever,"I would not accept this power/curse because it would limit my ability to experience the world around me. Reading a book is an enriching experience, but it requires time and dedication, and I would not be able to enjoy it if I was forced to absorb the knowledge instantly. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from a book is only a part of the overall experience, and I would miss out on the other aspects of reading, such as the pleasure of turning the pages and the excitement of discovering new ideas."

How do you take revenge?,"Sell it on ebay as ""the brick from that reddit thread"" and hopefully somebody rich buys it for more than 1000 dollars. ","There are several ways to take revenge on someone who has cheated you out of money, but the most important thing to remember is to not break the law. Some options include:

1. Spread the word: If you have been cheated out of money for a stupid brick, it's likely that the person who cheated you will try to pull the same trick on someone else. Spread the word about their shady business practices so that other people know to avoid them.

2. File a complaint: You can file a complaint with your local consumer protection agency or with the Better Business Bureau, who can investigate the case and take action against the person who cheated you.

3. Take legal action: If the person who cheated you is still in possession of the brick, you can take legal action to get your money back. You may even be able to sue for punitive damages, which can be used to punish the person who cheated you.

4. Seek revenge creatively: You can also get creative with your revenge. For example, if the person who cheated you is a business owner, you could start a campaign to boycott their business or post negative reviews online."

A photo of their bedroom can provide a lot of insight into their personality and lifestyle. It can show you what kind of furniture they have, what kind of decor they prefer, and even how tidy (or untidy) they are.

46,Former Flat Earthers. What made you come round?,"Quote I got from somewhere...

""for 5 years I believed the Earth was flat, then I turned 6""","I think the most common answer to this is simply that the evidence in favor of a round Earth became too overwhelming for people to ignore. As our access to technology and information increases, it becomes harder to deny the facts that support the round Earth theory. From satellite imagery to photographs taken from space, the evidence is hard to ignore. Additionally, many Flat Earthers come to the realization that the limited scope of their own experience is not necessarily indicative of what the larger universe looks like."

51,"Doctors of reddit, what’s it like when you go in for a doctors appointment? Do you and your doctor discuss what’s wrong with you like it’s a group project? Do you not go at all because you’re your own doctor?",Dr here - it is a bit dependent on the field of medicine involved. For example I don't know much about neurological issues so if I went to see a neurologist I certainly wouldn't be chipping in. For more generic conditions I have previously offered my thoughts to my doctor about what it could be. Ultimately I still go to the doctor as they can prescribe drugs/order tests for me that would be difficult/questionable for me to do myself.,"It really depends on the doctor and the type of appointment. Generally, my appointments are pretty straightforward. I'll explain my symptoms and the doctor will ask some questions to get a better understanding of my medical history. From there, we'll discuss a plan of action and any treatments that I might need. I find that my doctor is always very professional and respectful, and I always feel like I'm in good hands."

70,I can’t breathe. Black lives matter.,"I want to start by saying that when I say Black Lives Matter- there is an implied “too” at the end. I am NOT saying my life matters more, or your life matters less. Just that mine is equally important and not viewed as such by unfortunately, many people. “All Lives Matter” is disrespectful because it negates the purposeful attention we are trying to draw to black injustice specifically. I need you to please understand that racism is not the racism they taught us in school anymore.

Modern racism is giving black people higher interest rates or bad loans (which a bank was sued millions for doing in 2017!). It’s relators purposely not showing black people houses in nicer areas. It’s companies only hiring 1-5 black people for their quota and not for their merit, which is ironically racist towards whites who potentially deserved it more- spurring more division. It’s colleges only accepting black people to make themselves look good on paper instead of actually valuing that students strengths & potential. It’s enforcing laws in school that don’t allow black people to wear their natural hair because it is “unprofessional” and a “distraction” to other students. It’s makeup companies only having 1-3 dark foundation shades because we are a “demographic” without money & thus not worth pursuing- and then suddenly coming out with more shades once they see how successful Rihanna was when she acknowledged us. It’s crooked police purposely going into low income areas, scanning license plates, and purposely ticketing people they know cannot afford it, so that they will go to jail for outstanding tickets and become a part of the for-profit prison pipeline. It’s fashion companies & movies using damaging stereotypes of black people instead of showing how diverse and beautiful our people are, thus instilling an untrue idea of what “black people” are to others across the world (imagine you’re from a place with no black people- if all the movies & shows portray us a certain way, you’ll assume that must be true).

When  I first started at my old place of employment, a very nice tech company, I had a black  janitor stop me one morning as I was heading up to the office, tears in  his eyes. He gripped my shoulder; his hands frail, wrinkled- and told me  how proud of me he was. How happy he was that a little black girl was  working at “one of them tech companies”. I hugged him & told him  thank you. When I tell you I ran to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out.  I was so grateful, but that is a heavy burden to carry- not only was I  working for me, I was working for him, for all my ancestors who didn’t  have a chance. And when I was let go 2 months ago, it hit hard because it felt like  not only did I fail me, I failed them. I realize it was not my fault, a  virus hit the country and I was a part of a mass layoff. But do you see  how race played into my emotional state, something most others wouldn’t  have to deal with?

So please, when you see Black Lives Matter, when you see protest, know that all we’re asking for is change. Yes we have civil rights, but why are you scoffing at us asking for more? Why are we expected to accept the bare minimum? As a kid (mind you I was born in 1996) I was given the talk that my skin means I have to conduct myself a certain way, in certain environments, for my own safety. That people will fear me for simply having too much melanin. That I will be black first, yourelovely second until I die. I am trying my hardest to create a future where I don’t have to give my kids that same speech, where I don’t have to pass down that generational trauma.

If you have questions about the protesting, the movement, modern racism- ask me please! I know it can be a heated topic and the only way to change that is to have an open dialogue and educate. This is me offering the olive branch, me saying I am hurting and still have nothing but love in my heart. Too often we are too busy trying to share our thoughts that we don’t hear others.

EDIT: I've gotten a lovely amount of responses- I'm in Boston & its currently 12:13 am, I'm trying to get a semi-regular sleep schedule on track so I'll probably be heading to bed soon, please know if I don't get back to you tonight I will tomorrow! All love & hugs from me, thank you for making a girl feel heard",I'm so sorry you feel that way. Black lives absolutely matter and it's heartbreaking that we still have to say that in 2020. Please take some time to take care of yourself and your mental health.
71,"Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “If you can’t fly then run, if you can’t run then walk, if you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.” What are your life examples of this?","I rode my bike across the US.  Most of it solo.

In the middle of Missouri, I just ... had enough.  I stopped on some guys lawn and just cried.  He came out and asked me what was up and I explained how far I'd come (started in San Fransisco) and that I was just done.

He told me to ride into town (I think Springfield?) which was only 10 miles away and take a few days off and rest.  Which is what I did, because hey, one more day wouldn't matter, and the worst that would happen is that I'd pack it in and go home.

Well, a day of rest seemed to be exactly what I needed.  I spent a whole day (or most of it, anyway) in blessed air conditioning, ate all the food, drank all the water, and was more or less ready to go again.

I took a few more one-day breaks between Missouri and Williamsburg, VA which really helped me out.

So yeah, one step back, two steps forward.","My life example of this is that when I face a challenge, I don't give up. I take the initiative to keep pushing forward no matter how small the steps may be. When I was in college, I was struggling with a particular class. Instead of giving up, I worked with my professor to develop a plan to get me back on track and I eventually passed the course. This experience taught me that no matter how difficult something may seem, it is possible to keep pushing forward and achieve success."
72,"Women of reddit, what do you think about the fall of constantinople in 1453 by the ottoman forces led by Mehmed II?","Welp I'm a Greek woman and I'm doing my masters in history, and have done a paper on the music about the fall of Constantinople. In summary, the fall of Constantinople was kind of inevitable. The empire was in its last legs, due in large part to the the fall during the fourth crusade in 1204. It had a lot of internal and external problems. For example, Konstantinos Palaiologos was never officially coronated, due to religious infighting. The Ottoman empire had already conquered all of the farmland around, and was right to go for the kill at the time that it did. It conquered a great strategic and cultural landmark. The Hagia Sophia had already become a mosque in 29th May 1453, 2.30 in the afternoon. It's a pity for my heritage, but at that time I think it was inevitable.

Edit: wtf guys thanks!! O.O
Edit no. 2: Actually no, guys, the paper wasn't on There might be giants! It was on Greek folk laments on the event of the fall, and how accurate were their lyrics in relation to the actual event. (There were fairly accurate, also deeply sad and lamenting the loss of a symbol, mostly, not the city itself).","I think it was a tragic event in world history that had long-reaching consequences. It marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, a major cultural and economic center, and ushered in a new era of Ottoman rule. The fall of Constantinople also had an impact on the Christian world, with the Orthodox Church losing its center in the city. It was a significant event in the development of the modern world."

I would be amazed that my life was simulated in such a short amount of time and that I was able to experience it in such a vivid way. I would also feel a sense of loss, wondering what could have been if I had continued playing the simulation.

They'll adopt you first.,"I think this is a very noble idea. Adopting elderly people who have lost their children would be a great way to show them love and support in their time of need. It would also give them a sense of family and belonging, which is something that can be hard to find in later life. It would be a great opportunity to build strong relationships and provide a valuable service to our elderly population."

90,How would you feel about at least one presidential primary debate being replaced with a history/civics themed contest of Jeopardy between the candidates?,"People who are saying it wouldn't have much value may have a point, but it wouldn't be any more useless than the bullshit they do now.

Edit: if you can find it, look up the very first tv debate between Richard Nixon and JFK. They discussed substantive positions and laid out clear policy differences in a respectful, somber manner. Now it's all just angling for one-liner sound bites that they hope will get airplay in the next news cycle.

Edit 2: I feel a deep sense of satisfaction that my top comment of all time expresses my frustration at the inanity of the current political process in the US.",I think replacing one of the presidential primary debates with a history/civics themed contest of Jeopardy between the candidates would be a great idea. It would give voters a chance to see the candidates in a different light and demonstrate their knowledge of the issues at hand. It could also be a more entertaining way to learn about the candidates and their policies.

93,"Redditors who work at remote places like forest officers, oil rig workers, etc, what creepy things have you noticed while at work?","I used to work at a Boy Scout Summer Camp. Every week I had to take a big group of campers to a ""secluded"" spot for their wilderness survival badge where they had to build a shelter out of sticks, leaves, etc and sleep in it overnight. The spot was only about 1/2 mile from the main camp, but we took them a circuitous route that made it seem really secluded.

Anyways, on this one night all the campers had made their shelters, we had cooked dinner, and were all just sitting around the campfire. It was getting late, maybe 11:00, so I sent all the campers to their shelters for the night and started cleaning up the fire. That's when we heard in the distance what sounded like church bells. They were pretty faint, but myself and my fellow staffers could definitely hear them. They went on for about 30 minutes, ringing every 30 seconds, or so. We were all a little creeped out, as there were no churches or towns within 20 miles of us. After the bells stopped, though, the singing started. It was too faint to hear the words, but it sounded like church choir music, but **a lot** of people, and **a lot** more enthusiastic. Also, it was almost midnight at this point. The singing went on for well over an hour, sometimes quieting down until we almost couldn't hear it, sometimes getting so loud we thought it was getting closer.

All of the campers were super creeped out, but I lied to them, telling them there was a church service going on in camp, and that there was nothing to be scared of. Eventually, at almost 1 AM, the singing stopped. I found out a few days later that there had been a large KKK rally only a few miles away that night, and that's what we had heard.","I used to work as a forest officer and the most creepy thing I noticed was the sudden disappearance of my co-worker one day. He had gone on a routine patrol, but he never returned. We searched for weeks, but never found any trace of him. It was really unsettling and we never knew what happened to him."
94,"Have you ever felt you don't know/have forgotten who you really are? That you've spent years just adapting to surroundings to make life easier and don't know what's the real you anymore? If so, how did you overcome this?","There's probably no ""real you"" that exists across time. That's just a thing you built up when you were younger to give yourself a stable identity and core values.

The you now is just as real as the you then. We all adapt to our surroundings and change to make our lives easier. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.

If you're unhappy with your life now, you can adapt by changing. You need to believe that, and you probably know it since it seems to be something you're afraid of. But this is the real you now, and you need to focus on the needs of that person, not some idealized phantom from the past.","Yes, I have felt this way before. To overcome this, I had to take some time to reflect on what I truly valued in life and what I wanted to be my core values. I had to make a conscious effort to live according to those values, even if it meant making difficult decisions or going against the grain. I also had to take a step back and look at my life objectively, and be honest with myself about what I had been doing and why. This helped me to realign my life with my true self and to start living in a way that felt more authentic."
95,"People who are 40+ and happy with their life, what is your advice to people in their 20s?","I am 40 years old and I have three pieces of advice for anyone in their 20's

1. Accept that perfection doesn't exist. Your relationships will have problems, your car will break down, someone else will anyways have a better phone, a newer car, or a bigger house than you, no matter where on the social ladder you stand. Constantly chasing perfection will keep you permanently stressed. That doesn't mean you should not try to better your life, just know that if you expect perfection you will never be statisfied. 

2. Pay attention to your diet and health. I have been working out at least 4 times per week since my mid 20's. I am fitter, healthier and look younger than almost everyone else my age

3. Don't stop doing the things you love. Even though I have a wife, kids, job etc. I still make time to play video games, draw, write stories, read comics, play basketball, listen to music, etc. There is no reason to become a miserable old bastard!

EDIT: Wow! This has blown up way more than I expected. Thanks for the awards a guys. Its nice to know my advice can be useful to others.

EDIT 2: So, quite a few people have asked how I find time to fit in all these hobbies. As I said, I have to make the time. Apart from working out (which I do at 6am before everyone else wakes up) I'm not doing these things every day. I only game on the weekend if I get the chance, I read ebooks on my phone when I'm killing time in the day, I may buy a comic 2-3 times a year and I can usually find a few hours in the week to draw. I still make time to chill out with my wife in the evenings and do things with kids. I just fit my hobbies in between them. I also don't watch much TV or go out, but that's just me.","My advice to people in their 20s is to take the time to find out what truly brings you joy and fulfillment. Don't be afraid to explore and try new things, as you never know what could be the right fit for you. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn from them. Don't be afraid to take risks and be bold. Most importantly, don't be afraid to be yourself. Life is too short to try to be someone you are not."

What will be their modern day equivalent a few centuries from now?","Already started that way, but gangsters.","In a few centuries, the modern day equivalent of pirates may be hackers. As technology advances, hackers will become more sophisticated in their tactics and will be seen as a bigger threat.

Although they will be seen as a menace, their ability to innovate will also be admired, and their skills will be respected and sought after."

I see a lot of family members/Carers feeling ashamed of the fact that they are finding it incredibly difficult to care for someone that has dementia or a chronic mental health problem.

Carer burnout is a real issue and people need to know that it’s not easy to see someone you love struggling every day, or slowly fading away month by month. Carers and family members desperately need time for themselves and need to know that it’s okay to feel the way that they do. 

No one is superhuman and we all have our own needs. It’s why we have therapy groups for Carers. It’s okay to struggle to look after someone and you should in no way feel ashamed of having those feelings.

Right. 

It was a standard office Xerox printer. It took me all of 30 seconds to find and click the ‘collate’ button.  Clicked the ‘staple’ button while at it. 

All got printed by itself into nice stapled packets and I got paid to browse internet for the day.

He ended up completing it in a fraction of the time that we thought it would take, and he did it with fewer resources than we expected. He had found the easiest way to complete the task.

They married young and it didn't occur to them that it would be strange if she went on the honeymoon and he stayed behind. He was a good guy and just wanted to see her happy and she really wanted to go on this vacation, because she had never left the country.

They seperated half a year after the wedding and my friend, the bride, told me, that the marriage had been a way to prolong the relationship despite both of them knowing that it was already over some time before they got married. Kinda like a couple gets a baby to save a marriage. It really was just sad because they were a nice couple, but they stayed friends after seperating.

And I can guarantee that she didn't cheated on him while away, they were both really loyal. 

About his sun allergy: he had red hair, a really fair skin and burned up within minutes. And I mean really bad sunburn, the kind you have to go to the hospital for.

146,How would you feel about a law requiring parents that receive child support to supply the court with proof of how the child support money is being spent?,"I would be for it.. however: the reason why no law exists is because it would be insanely difficult and expensive to enforce. 

Think about it. Ex bought the brand name cereal instead of the no-name brand? You see that on her grocery bill ""No way! Not on my watch. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!""  You're laughing... ""haha, no way anyone would be so petty...."" Nope. 

Enforcing accountability in child support provided expenses just opens up the worst legal can of worms imaginable. 

edit: as for why I'd like to see it: I don't have any visibility into how my money gets spent and it irks me. Further more, my ex frequently rings up and asks for the next support payment early. Yes, often times there are valid reasons. So and so needed shoes. Fees for school trips. etc. But I also know she spends way above her means on a lot of fun, entertainment based discretionary things, then she realizes ""whups, can't buy groceries! tee hee! pleeeeeze?"". So she gets to be the ""fun"" parent. Welp kids, looks like we're going for long walks in the park again this weekend. Hooray for the library.

edit2: ok, 600 replies. Child support is contentious on Reddit. So far, the themes are:

- yes, its 2017, we should have the technology to implement this. Maybe some magic debit card or EBT style.
- no, current child support departments are bunged up enough, this would kill them.
- stop giving in to your ex - if she asks for money early in the future just ask what she needs specifically and buy it for her, then take that off the subsequent payment - GOOD idea!.
- people are petty.
- so put a law like this in motion. But to prevent abuse, the cost for an audit is borne by the parent who asked for it... or variations on that (I _like_ that idea.)
- ARTICHOKE SCULPTURE
- ok we got a sprog in here.","I think this would be a very controversial law, as it could be seen as an infringement on parental rights and privacy. On the other hand, it could be beneficial in ensuring that child support money is being used for the child's benefit. Ultimately, I think this is a decision that should be left to the individual parent and the court should not impose such a rule."

148,Australian Bushfire Crisis,"As an Australian, I want to thank the international community for acknowledging the extent of this crisis and their ongoing support. I’m not directly affected by the fires, but it’s amazing to see complete strangers across the world donate to our charities and send firefighters to help us and the animals during this time. 

So from the bottom of my heart, thank you!

EDIT: thank you for all the comments and support. I agree, our government should be doing more and it’s a shame that we have to result to asking for help. I hope our government is held accountable.

As others have said, many other countries are faced with devastating floods or other disasters due to climate change. Please, let’s make an effort to be better and challenge those in power to do better. Climate change is real, we have one planet. Let’s take care of it.","The Australian bushfire crisis is an ongoing event which has been occurring since September of 2019. The crisis has so far caused mass destruction of property and loss of life, with over 17 million hectares of land burned, 3,000 homes destroyed, and 33 lives lost. The cause of the bushfires are due to a combination of the dry climate caused by climate change, high temperatures, and strong winds. The crisis has been exacerbated by the mismanagement of the forests and the lack of controlled burning, which has allowed the fires to spread rapidly.

In response to the crisis, the Australian government has declared a state of emergency and has committed over $1 billion to relief efforts. The government has also implemented a number of measures to help those affected, including providing emergency relief payments, increasing access to mental health services, and providing assistance to volunteer firefighters. Additionally, the government has also established a National Bushfire Recovery Agency to coordinate the national response and provide long-term support to affected communities.

The bushfire crisis has had a devastating impact on the environment, with estimates of over 1 billion animals affected. In response, the Australian government has announced a $50 million recovery fund to help protect and restore habitats and species affected by the fires. Additionally, the government has committed to a $2 billion package to help regenerate and restore the affected areas.

The Australian bushfire crisis is an ongoing event and will require the continued support of the government and the public to ensure the recovery of affected communities and the environment."

152,Would limiting the age of the President to 65 be something you’d support? Why or why not?,I think the US should implement a ranked choice voting system. I think that will have a much bigger impact on our political system.,"I would not support limiting the age of the President to 65. I believe that age should not be a factor when considering a person's qualifications for the position. A person's experience, qualifications, and ability to lead should be the primary criteria when considering someone for the role of President. Age should not be a factor, as some 65-year-olds may have more experience and better qualifications than some younger candidates. Additionally, I believe that each individual should be allowed to decide when they are ready to step down from a position of leadership, regardless of age."

155,How do you deal with an overly friendly neighbor who asks too many questions about your life when you happen to be outdoors at the same time?,"If you're not very open to chat, just keep things polite yet quick. It's nice to have a good relationship with your neighbors. If they do delve into personal questions, just say ""that's a bit personal, I'd rather not talk about that."" Most important thing is to be polite. Don't be an asshole, or act standoffish when it's not necessary.

Honestly, just use some common sense. Don't be a ""redditor"", is all I'm saying.","If you feel uncomfortable with the situation, it’s perfectly okay to politely but firmly set boundaries. You can say something like, “I appreciate your friendliness, but I’m not comfortable discussing my personal life.” You can also suggest a change of topic to something less personal, or you can excuse yourself and go back inside. If the neighbor continues to push for more information, you may need to be more direct and firmly tell them that you are not interested in discussing your personal life."
156,Would you support a mandatory environmental service for adults 18 - 30 ? Kind of like military service but instead of fighting you must spend a few months on reforestation projects or ocean cleanup ? Why or why not ?,"Not mandatory, but there was a voluntary program like this in the US in the Depression.  It was called the Civilian Conservation Corps.  Participants got room and board, clothing, job training, and $30 a month, of which $25 had to be sent home (most were single young men, so it went to their parents & younger siblings), in exchange for working on various projects on public land throughout the country.  The reasons for it were both to provide jobs and because the Dust Bowl had opened people's eyes to the fact that the US was not a bottomless well of natural resources.  (Erosion was a big cause of the Dust Bowl, and the Dust Bowl was a factor in the Depression, so it all tied together.)  They were also called ""Roosevelt's Tree Army,"" because one of the big things they did was plant trees for erosion control.  

In my state, they built most of the state parks, a lot of them in areas that had been deforested for charcoal manufacturing and were marginal for agriculture.  You can still rent out cabins that they built, and they're great--really attractive, and shockingly inexpensive.  (I'm actually going to stay in one next week.)  Some of them have photos from the CCC days on the walls, and it's really neat to look at them and know that you're still enjoying what they worked on.  

I'd definitely support a program like that today, but I think making it voluntary is (putting ethical considerations to one side) more practical--for one thing, you would have to pay participants (just like people drafted for military service get paid), and it would be very expensive if everyone did it.  Plus having it be voluntary means the number of participants can be matched the amount of meaningful work to be done, and the workers are more motivated.  With the CCC, people considered themselves lucky to be picked--$30 a month was an attractive wage, and three square meals every single day was a significant perk--so discipline was straightforward: do what you're supposed to do or get kicked out, and most people didn't want to get kicked out.  It would probably take stronger incentives to get the same level of buy-in today, but health care and student loan forgiveness would be a good start.

Edit:  A number of people have asked about how you rent the cabins I mentioned.  The ones I'm familiar with are in Pennsylvania and can be reserved at https://pennsylvaniastateparks.reserveamerica.com/.  Not all cabins are CCC-built, but ones listed as ""rustic"" often are--check individual park websites for details.  (There's usually a ""stay the night"" page with information on the cabins, and sometimes a ""history"" page that will talk about CCC's role in the park.)  Rates are based on the number of beds in the cabin and start at $35 a night for cabins that sleep four; weekends and peak times are higher, and there is a surcharge if you're not a Pennsylvania resident.  The system takes reservations up to 11 months in advance--some parks fill up quickly.  Some parks allow dogs in specific designated cabins, and most parks have at least one ADA-accessible unit.   

Other states and some national parks also have CCC-built cabins available for rental, but as far as I know there's no nationwide system to find out where they are.","I think that mandatory environmental service could be beneficial in some ways, if it was done in a way that was properly planned and thought out. For instance, if it was done in a way that would ensure that the environmental service was done in a way that was sustainable, and that would have long-term effects, then I could support it. However, if it was done in a way that would simply be a short-term solution, then I would not support it. Additionally, I think that it is important to consider the impact of such a program on the people who would be required to participate in it. If it was done in a way that would be too costly or too disruptive to their lives, then I would not support it."

169,Which conspiracy theory is so believable that it might be true?,[removed],"One conspiracy theory that is widely believed is the existence of a secret government agency called the Majestic 12. This theory claims that in 1947, President Harry Truman established a covert organization to investigate unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and extraterrestrial life. Supporters of the theory cite alleged leaked documents, documents from the Freedom of Information Act, and witness accounts as evidence of the organization's existence. While the U.S. government has never officially acknowledged the Majestic 12, the belief that it exists is still firmly entrenched in many conspiracy theorists' minds."

181,What’s the cringiest thing you’ve seen a bride and groom do for their wedding?,"At a classmates’ wedding. They were young - maybe like 22? 23? There is apparently a caking tradition in some parts of the country, where when they cut the wedding cake, the couple feed each other a bit and smear each other’s faces with cake as a joke. The bride had absolutely made 1000% clear to the groom she did NOT want to be caked. 

He did it anyways, and not just a small smear, but full on smushed the slice in her face. She was stunned initially, then got up, face full of cake, yelled “YOU ASSHOLE  I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THAT!” and then ran to a back area in the reception. The groom tried to follow but the bridesmaids/mother of the bride stopped him. So he sat at the head table awkwardly while half the wedding party rushed off with the bride.

She stayed back there for like an hour. They eventually did let him back there to check on her. We could hear her crying and them arguing. The rest of the reception came to a screeching halt until one of the bride’s aunts emerged and directed the servers to clear the tables and put on some music. 

They got divorced 2 years later.","The cringiest thing I've seen a bride and groom do for their wedding was when they had a choreographed dance routine to a popular song. Everyone was so embarrassed watching them, but they seemed to be having a great time."

Undeterred, García created a fictional persona as a pro-fascist Spanish official & got himself recruited by the Nazis, who directed him to travel to Britain to recruit agents. Instead, García created a network of fictitious agents & sub-agents using publicly available information like newspapers & travel brochures. It was at this point that he again contacted Allied intelligence, & he was finally recruited. García continued his work throughout the war, & for the same operation, he received both a knighthood from the British & the Iron Cross from Nazi Germany.

We were signing the contract for the event and I kept thinking that it was quite remote, so I asked: ""how much time does it take for the ambulance to get here?"" 

I became the laughing stock of both families. My (then future) mother in law, who was present at the meeting, literally fell down from the chair laughing. The wedding organizer, remembered it for weeks, telling about it everyone we met. My dad, ended every sentence with ""...but maybe you need an ambulance for that"". My wife was making siren noises, when I was saying something we disagreed on. Every family dinner all the aunts and uncles were ""checking"" if the ambulance was present. You name it. The entire package.

Still I couldn't get rid of this weird feeling. It would have taken over an hour for the ambulance to get to the garden. After a few weeks I ended up paying a private ambulance to be present at the wedding.

Fast forward to the ceremony. As my wife literally walks down the aisle, at the back of the garden I see two Paramedics running with a stretcher and my dad squeezing my hand whispering: ""that's not of your god damn business, let them to take care of it. ""

What happened was that one of our older guests got a heart attack and almost died at ceremony. Was saved by the private ambulance.

Ever since then, when my wife tells me that I'm overthinking, I just do the siren noise.





EDIT

Well... thanks for the awards everybody, glad you liked the story. I promise you that I was tired of winning after that. They never heard the end of it, but all the laughs were in good spirit.

I have worked at an airport and have spoken to a security officer who helped a woman stop being transported and killed. 

The woman did not know she wasn’t going to be coming home, until she got to the airport and her husband went to the toilet and she realised only he had a return ticket. 
She somehow managed to quickly think to hide her bangle so that she could set the metal detector off and have to be searched. As the officer was up close and searching her, the woman whispered “help me”. The officer quickly took her for a private search, grabbed the woman’s bags and passport too ‘as protocol’ and went into the private search room. The woman fell on the floor crying, begging for help, so they called the police. The husband started to get suspicious and tried to break his way into the room and the officer had to push against the door, thankfully the police turned up straight away and restrained him. He was arrested and she was given protection and moved to a new city to start a new life. It was harrowing to hear, and really awful to know that this goes on!

One patient refused to have the swab taken because she thought covid was a hoax.

I argued that my client had not breached the contract and that the evidence was not relevant. I cited a legal precedent that stated that evidence of a breach of contract must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. The opposing counsel argued that the evidence was relevant and that it should be admitted.

At that point, I knew I had the upper hand. I argued that the evidence was not relevant because it did not meet the clear and convincing evidence standard.

239,“A child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.” What is an example of this that you’ve seen or experienced firsthand?,"I used to be into amateur radio after a short stint in the army cadets. There was one guy, in the east Midlands, UK, who was one of the adult instructors. He was always telling us about amateur radio, and would hand out old/cheaper pieces of tech he'd tried out and wasn't keeping.

Anyway, he was a little weird, overly friendly (with adults, never had any bad vibes around the kids) and obviously had some social anxiety which he was compensating for, personally I suspect he was on the autistic spectrum, but who knows. After I left the cadets and went to Uni, I stayed in touch on Facebook. We were in the same Facebook group for amateur radio hobbyists.

He always liked to do things by the book, and instilled in us the importance of being responsible and socially conscious with our radio use. He was the same on Facebook, reminding people that Mrs Miggins on her £10 handset wouldn't know about transmission power, and squelch, etc. He mentioned in passing to a new member the importance of only using the public unlicensed channels (kind of like CB Radio in the US) on the correct, very low, power setting of half a watt. He mentioned it was because Mrs Miggins trying to reach her kid in the next street wouldn't understand the idea that she could hear you but couldn't reach you to ask you to be quiet a minute. He was correct here, and it's also a criminal offence to transmit at higher power on these frequencies, even though its not enforced. 

Anyway, this got someone's back up, and he was kicked from the group for ""preaching"".

After unsuccessfully asking to be let back in, he set up a larger antenna in his back garden, set up a super fancy aerial atop it, with a 30 Watt transmission system... (this is really quite powerful) 

He now turns this on for several hours a day on whatever channels the radio club/group are using to 'teach them the importance of good etiquette'. This means that nobody can use certain frequencies for hours at a time, as it just sounds like someone is having a one way conversation on air.

He could probably get arrested, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all.","I have seen firsthand how a lack of support from a community can lead to a child engaging in destructive behaviors in order to gain attention or acceptance.

262,"What’s a small act of kindness you were once shown, that you’ll never forget?","So once in high school, I ate at a Mexican restaurant and unknowingly threw away my car keys on my tray when I was done eating. I went and asked a worker if he had cleared them off the table and he said no, but that he had just taken the trash out to the dumpster. I remember going outside and calling my dad to ask if there was a spare and he told me no. So I went back inside feeling humiliated and about to ask if I could look through the dumpster only to see that this man had already dug through the dumpster on my behalf and ended up finding my keys for me. He just went above and beyond and to this day I am so grateful for his help.","When I was in college, I was struggling with a particularly difficult class. One day, I was stressed out and near tears in the library. A complete stranger saw me and asked me if I was okay.

The longest pause was 45,9 hours between 7th and 9th of June 2017.

So the current pause isn't unprecedented, but still rare. Once it gets to 46 hours it will be a first during the presidency.

Edit: I exported everything since 01-01-2017 from [here](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive), hassled a bit with the U.S. date and time format and then did a simple subtraction between each subsequent tweet time.

Edit2: 27 hours so far, which leaves 21 cases where at least this long has passed between 2 tweets since the beginning of 2017. In 6 more hours (33 hours since the last tweet), this will be down to 6 cases over the same time period - 33,7 hours, 34 hours, 37,3 hours, 38,5 hours, 40,3 hours and 45,9 hours. This should probably cover the interesting information.

Edit3: The president has returned: https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1109787378242240514 The final count was 39 hours 46 minutes, which makes this the 3rd largest gap between tweets during this presidency. By the look of the tweet, it might be that Trump was aware that the unusual pause had been noticed. This should wrap up this thread now.","My theory is that President Trump is focusing on his duties in the White House and getting his agenda accomplished. He may also be taking a break from social media as he prepares for the upcoming 2020 election. It is also possible that he is taking a break from Twitter to avoid any potential backlash from his recent controversial statements. Finally, he may be taking a break from Twitter to focus on upcoming meetings and negotiations."

I also have no clue to this day how my nan every passed her test in her 70s she can’t drive to save her life had she been 18 they would have failed her 100%","No, elderly people should not be forced to take tests regarding their motor vehicle operating abilities and mental fitness and have their license revoked if they fail. Elderly people should be given the right to make decisions for themselves regarding their driving abilities, and it should be up to them to decide when it is time to stop driving. Tests can be used as a tool to assess an individual's driving abilities, but it should not be used as the sole determinant.

Although birds like swans and flamingoes are using the edges of their habitats more.","Many of the animals that are used to having large numbers of visitors are a bit less active now that the visitors are gone. They seem to be a bit more relaxed and comfortable in their environment when there are no people around. Some of the animals that are used to interacting with people may be a bit confused and looking for attention. We have also observed some animals that are typically more shy coming out of their shells more and exploring their enclosures.

While she was distracted, I opened up the settings, changed her password to my birthdate, and then set her phone down. 

Cue 15 minutes later, she's trying to get into her phone and it's not working. Suspecting mischief, she grumpily asks me if I've changed the password to her phone in front of our entire family. I admit that I did.

Everyone seems to be assuming that other life means humanoid or intelligent. To me it just means any life form.  Carbon based or made of elements unknown to our galaxy.  There has to be something else.,"I think the idea that we are not alone in the universe is scarier. The thought of encountering unknown creatures or civilizations that may be hostile or have advanced technology that could be used against us is unsettling.

306,[Serious] How would you react if the US government decided that The American Imperial units will be replaced by the metric system?,"So you don't realize that they did this in the 70's? The US government went metric back then, but made it voluntary for the rest of us. That's why there are metric units on food. The people rejected it. It's still the official standard, however.","I would be disappointed, as I've grown up using Imperial units and they are deeply embedded in my understanding of measurements.

He said getting locked back into his cell was the singular moment that completely turned his life around.","One of the best moments I have seen was when a spoiled rich kid had to take a job as a janitor in a local school. It was a humbling experience for the kid, who had been used to getting everything they wanted. The job helped the kid to understand the value of hard work and the importance of earning money.

313,Reddittors who were born deaf; do subtitles like “dogs barking” and “tense music” help even if you’ve never heard them? What do you imagine them to be like?,I’m deaf and it helps in certain contexts. If it’s just a shot of a farm and it says dog barking it’s out of context so it’s like whatever. But if it says dog barking to warn the person it definitely helps in that context. It also depends on how good the subtitles are. Netflix is superb at doing subtitles but cable tv is that good so by the time the subtitles come up it’s already a different scene or different convo.,"Subtitles like “dogs barking” and “tense music” do not help people who are born deaf. They may help to provide a bit of context to the scene, but they cannot replace the actual sound. For people who are born deaf, it can be difficult to imagine what certain sounds are like since they have never heard them before. They may use their imagination to create a mental image of what the sound could be like."

She didn't have fucking anxiety, she had a medical condition.

EDIT: a few clarifications. Patient cause of death was unrelated. I won't give any details because it may get too identifying. I am UK based and this was an NHS post mortem.

My husband had kissed me goodbye and gone to work. I was cleaning the house for company who was coming to stay the weekend. The doorbell rang. There was a man at my door who introduced himself as the husband of a woman who my husband worked with. He was there to tell me that my husband and his wife were having an affair. He had busted them about six months prior and had told his wife that she had to end the affair. He thinks that she did end it...for about three months, but then they started up again. When he found out they were at it again, he called my husband (because he knew if he confronted him in person, he'd be in a jail cell for what he'd have done). On the phone, he told my husband to leave his wife alone or else he would come and tell me everything that was happening. Apparently, my husband thought that he was bluffing.

I’m a speech therapist who works in an inner city elementary children where we see a lot of poverty, drug abuse, etc. I had one case stand out to me in particular that stands out. 

I saw a little girl, 7 years old, who had been delayed on her language skills. We knew she had a very difficult upbringing since she was the product of a rape. She lived only with her mother who impressively kept the two events (the rape and the birth of her daughter) as separated as possible. The rapist (who I refuse to call a father) had served time in jail but was released at this point on house arrest. He had no rights to see her. But the rapist’s parents, technically the child’s grandparents, went to court and  demanded rights to see their “granddaughter”. They refused to ever believe their son was a rapist. Some judge, who I hope thinks of this case often, allowed it as long as father was not present. It started as supervised visits and eventually turned into visitation without supervision. Mom fought as hard as she could, but she couldn’t afford a lawyer like the grandparents could. Mom had to drop her daughter off to the parents of her rapist every other weekend for one night. I don’t know how she did it.

Anyways, I started to see a huge regression in her language skills. Her mean length of utterance decreased, she couldn’t logically organize her thoughts into sentences, she couldn’t categorize anymore and so forth. Academically when I spoke to the teacher she said the same thing. But it really came to a head when she started to regress in other, non-school related skills. 
One day she wet her pants in my classroom. And she just lost it. She was crying, she destroyed my room, she was hitting and punching to the point where I had to restrain her from hurting herself. She just lost it. Finally when she calmed down, I brought her down to the nurse, got her a change of pants. But this was a girl was not only potty trained since Id known her, but she was known for being sweet, polite and just slow to warm up. She was NOT a child to have outbursts like this. She wasn’t sick. And I felt like I really needed to say something outside the school.

Long story short, grandparents were sneaking over to fathers house so that her “father could see and help raise his daughter”. Turns out he started inappropriately touching her in the bathroom, during tub time, at the kitchen table, watching TV. Basically any chance he could when the grandparents walked out the room for any amount of time.

My heart broke for the mom. I’ll never forget her telling us about how she couldn’t live with herself knowing the fact that the man who raped her, also touched her daughter. Anyways, you can probably imagine all the hurt and heartbreak the mother felt.","1. Unexplained bruises, cuts, or other physical injuries
2. Unusual changes in behavior, such as sudden mood swings, depression, or aggression

He wanted to rob a jewellers on our city's main street. So he found out the flat beside the jewellers was empty and he hid there. For 2 weeks he triggered the alarm on purpose several times a night, massive headache for the police and the business, we turned up to see nothing there, nothing on cameras, thought it was just a fluke so the jewellers turned off the alarm system and said they'd wait until the morning to get a new one installed or that one re-wired because something wasn't right. 
As soon as he heard that and the police leaving he tore down the wall (hed already been working on this apparently) and robbed the place taking his sweet time. Escaped without anyone noticing anything for hours, until the jewellers came back in the morning. 
Then he tried to re-sell something he stole which had a serial number on it and got caught. So not that smart after all. Good effort though.
","I had a case involving a suspect who was extremely intelligent and savvy. He was able to pull off a string of highly sophisticated robberies without leaving any evidence behind.

I probably couldn’t afford to keep up with more than two friends at the rate of this particular scenario that’s all entirely in my head.","If marriages were 5 to 10 year contracts with options to renew if both parties accept, the world would be different in several ways. For one, couples would have to be more conscious of their commitment to each other and the relationship, as they would be required to reevaluate their partnership every 5-10 years. This could potentially lead to more honest conversations about a couple's compatibility and future plans. Additionally, couples would have more freedom to explore different paths and lifestyles during the course of their marriage, as they would not be tied to each other indefinitely. The divorce rate could also decrease, as couples would not feel obligated to stay in unhappy relationships."

Sitting here now in my early 30's and it really hits home.","The phrase “you’ll understand it when you’re older” is often used to explain a concept or experience that can only be fully appreciated with age and experience. Therefore, it is difficult to pinpoint a single most “you’ll understand it when you’re older” thing as it is a subjective concept."

housekeeping gets the brunt of it. i’ve seen them carry out bags of used sex toys, peel used condoms off of every surface, and scrub shit - actual human (presumably) shit - off places there’s no reason for human shit to be.

the worst, though, was the couple that wanted a home birth but not, you know, at home (because gross). we had to deal with that hazmat situation. fucked them as hard as we could with penalties and fees, though.","1. Poor compensation for employees: Employees at 5-star hotels often receive below-average wages and few benefits. This means that many employees are overworked and underpaid.

2. Unsatisfactory working conditions: Many 5-star hotels have strict rules and regulations that can make it difficult for employees to do their jobs. This can lead to a lack of job satisfaction and a high turnover rate.

3. Unsavory guests: 5-star hotels attract a wide range of customers, some of whom may be rude or disrespectful to employees. Management may not want to reveal the extent of these issues.

4. Poor customer service: Many 5-star hotels are known for their luxurious amenities and services, but this may not always be the case. Poor customer service can lead to negative reviews and a tarnished reputation."

397,"[Serious] Dark Web users of Reddit, was there ever a point in your use that you felt you were genuinely in danger? What happened?","Not the modern ""dark web,"" but back in the days of Usenet I posted some harsh cl8riticism in alt.religion.sciebtology (yes, that was a typo for ""Scientology"" but I'm leaving it for context of a bunch of posts).

The online threats were funny, but when I started getting death threats by mail I backed the fuck off.

edit: I didn't think this would blow up like it did, but to answer a few common questions,

- I posted a bunch or criticism of the CoS in the Usenet group alt.religion.scientology. This was in the late '90s and well before most modern forums and content aggregators like Reddit existed (Fark was the big one and Digg was just starting to get popular).

-I was high school (for non Americans, grades 9-12)

-I was in high school and was using my home computer as an FTP server for a Warez group on IRC because I convinced my dad to sign up for a 90 day free trial of this new thing called ""broadband."" I had 3 Mbps down and 1.5 Mbps up. Of course we never cancelled it.

-They figured out who I was by using a CuteFTP vulnerability to get root directory access to my PC. The death threats were bad enough, but what really sticks with me is the malice of deleting my family photos including the last picture is us with my dad whole he was alive.

-I was the typical invincible-feeling young adult and I was more concerned about worrying my mom than I was about my own safety.

-This was long before ""doxxing"" was a thing, and online threats going from email to handwritten letters was terrifying, but as a high school kid I never would have admitted it.

-Nobody asked, but if I was confronted in person I would have fought back. 18 years later, if they really held a grudge and threatened me again with the same malice expressed in those letters I got, I would open the door with a gun in hand and if they tried to get in, I would assume that they were intending to kill me and shoot first.

-This is a serious post so as funny as it would be to accept the previous statement with the autocomplete error ""shit first,"" I fixed it.","Yes, there have been a few points where I felt genuinely in danger. One of the most memorable was when I was attempting to purchase something from a vendor who had a reputation for being unreliable. I had sent the money for the purchase, but the vendor had not sent the item or responded to messages for weeks. It got to the point where I was worried that I had been scammed and that the vendor, who was located in a country with a high crime rate, might take some sort of action against me.

The woman at the desk said she would call maintenance and asked for a phone number they could reach me at. I said there wasn’t one because my cell phone was locked in my apartment. She insisted she needed a number. I said I could give her the number but that I wouldn’t be able to answer if they called. She suggested I get my phone out of my apartment so that I could answer when they called. I rolled my eyes at her and said if I could get in my apartment to get my cell phone I wouldn’t need maintenance to let me in. She never did understand me. But maintenance did show up ten minutes later.

Update - since a lot of people are asking... You don’t need a key to lock the door to the apartment, just to unlock it. On the way out the door, I turned the lock on the back of the doorknob and then pulled the door shut, locking the door. I had put my keys in my purse because I was also carrying a laptop bag and a few other things. I thought I picked up my purse with the other bags but I hadn’t.

Now, my husband has never, not once, ever called me a name or even raised his voice to me, so this is particularly hilarious.

2. Try to establish a regular sleep routine and avoid activities such as watching TV or using electronic devices late at night.

6. Consider using a white noise machine to help your partner fall asleep more peacefully.

417,"If Cinderella’s shoe fit perfectly, then why did it fall off when she ran?","Because magic users are tricksy.

The reason the glass slipper in Cinderella didn't turn back to a regular slipper (or disappear) at midnight is because the Fairy Godmother was messing with us: her main goal was to set Cinderella up for life, and to do that she needed a way for the Prince to find her. She could easily have magicked Cinderella into the life she wanted, arbitrary midnight deadline be damned, but instead the Fairy Godmother decided to make the Prince want her for her own qualities and to prove his love by tracking Cinderella down. To do that, she had to make sure that something was left behind, so she popped that little glass sumbitch off so the Prince would have a lead to follow.

We are all puppets in the hands of the Fairy Godmother.","Cinderella's shoe may have fallen off when she ran because her foot was not securely in the shoe. The shoe may have been too large or not tied tightly enough, allowing it to slip off as she moved."
418,"Casting staff or directors in general, how awkward is it to hire people for unattractive characters as in their whole role is being fat or ugly?","I’ve been a professional actor for over 20 years and I can say, not awkward at all.

If you have an interesting look and you have signed up for and showed up for a casting, you know the deal. Ugly actors aren’t less smart or self aware than good looking ones. For example, little people or dwarfves, they get into acting knowing that they will more likely be an elf in a Christmas special than end up like Peter Dinklage, but they want to act regardless. 

Bottom line? We are all too needy and self obsessed to feel awkward, even the ugly ones.","It can be awkward to hire people for unattractive characters, but it is important to remember that these roles can also be empowering.

2. Know Your Surroundings: Be aware of your surroundings and use them to your advantage. Look for objects that can be used as weapons or look for an escape route.

4. Be Aggressive: If you’re going to fight, fight aggressively. Don’t be afraid to use your body weight and size to your advantage.

5. Be Prepared: Make sure you are physically and mentally prepared for a fight. Wear protective gear such as a mouth guard and gloves, and practice martial arts or self-defense moves.

Judge was not in a humorous mood that day.","I once had a client who was a defendant in a criminal trial. He was charged with aggravated assault and battery. His defense was that he was defending himself from an attack by the alleged victim. My client had a history of mental illness and was on medication. 

The prosecution had a witness that was going to testify that my client had a history of being violent when off his medication. My client had been off his medication for a few days prior to the incident. 

The defense attorney knew this and decided to use it against him. On the stand, the defense attorney asked the witness if my client had ever been violent when off his medication. The witness said yes. The defense attorney then asked if my client had ever been violent when on his medication. The witness said no. 

The defense attorney then asked the witness if my client had been on his medication at the time of the incident. The witness said no. The defense attorney then asked the witness if my client had ever been violent when off his medication, and the witness said yes. 

My client was convicted and sentenced to a lengthy prison term. It was one of the worst examples of an attorney taking advantage of a vulnerable client that I had ever seen."

Bartender told me I had a call at the phone at the end of the bar. I go over and look around for a phone but can't find one. He then asks me if I need a cab and that I can wait out back for it to arrive. I had no idea what was going on, and after a few exhanges of quizzical looks he explained that a Manhattan is the safe drink. I just wanted a Manhattan. He said I was the first person in years to have ordered one at that bar.","My date was not the greatest, but the staff were incredibly helpful. They were very understanding and allowed me to order the “safeword” drink without any judgement.

440,"Daughters of reddit, what is something you wish your father knew about girls when you were growing up?","Guess I kind of consider myself a daddy's girl, so here are all the things I'd probably tell him now.

* All those times you just accepted things that were girly without ever attracting any kind of attention to it really went a long way towards helping me build a healthy perception of guys. You never expressed any kind of disdain or machismo when I asked for your help untangling my Barbie's hair or prodding you with magic fairy wands. 

* You never hesitated to teach me practical skills - and you never attributed gender to them. It was always, ""Come over here and let me show you how to snake the drain, because you're going to need to do this."" BTW dad, I snaked my first drain all on my own last month! I'm so glad you taught me.

* Thank you for bailing me out when I was in a pinch, no questions asked. No guilting, no attempts at squeezing out information. I felt like I could come to you with any dilemma. This took a load of my shoulders because Mom is so reactive and ""freak out first, maybe resolve later."" 

* You respect me, which makes me respect you even more. When I call you out on BS, you actually repent and reflect. You don't deflect back on me and pull the, ""I'm the parent and know better than you"" spiel. 

* You actually took the time to sit and watch my cartoons or (attempt) to understand my video games or other hobbies. Mom always turned up her nose. You didn't. Do you know how awesome it is to watch your Dad actually laugh at the cartoon your mother just dismissed as ""dumb"" minutes before? So gratifying.

* All those times you went shopping for groceries and picked up ladies sanitary supplies without any hesitation, even if you did affectionately rename the long super maxi pads, ""low-salt maxis.""

* Thank you for all those secret times you let me pick something out of the vending machine to eat when we were on trips together - you knew Mom would never allow it.

* You take great pride in ""embarrassing me"" - but you know exactly where to draw the line so it's endearingly goofy, not genuinely embarrassing. You know your audience and play to it. I feel no shame when my friends (or now-fiance) are around you.

* It's okay if your hands were too callused to properly tie my ballet skirt before classes. I could tie it myself. But I didn't tell you at the time because I knew it made you happy to help me. So don't be embarrassed because the fabric kept snagging on your calluses.

* I wish you took your dental hygiene more seriously. I think your lax attitude and seeing you lose a lot of your teeth didn't set the best example for my sister while we were growing up.

**EDIT - did not expect Gold, yikes!** I realize closing with a comment about my Dad's flossing habits is kind of lame but it was stream of consciousness. I'm getting married in the fall and have been planning on writing a letter to my parents separately, so many of the points I made here I already want to share with him. He's my hero!

**EDIT EDIT** Just in case people are worried, I adore my mom and we're really close. This probably makes her sound like a buzzkill, but I swear I could absolutely spend all day writing how incredible she is too. 

Also, I called my dad and the first thing he says when he picks up is, ""Oh good! I was hoping you'd call, I picked a song for our father-daughter dance at your wedding."" I was sure to tell him how I felt.","I wish my father knew that girls can be just as interested in sports and other traditionally “boy” activities as boys are. Growing up, I felt like he was always pushing me to do more traditionally “girly” things, and I always wanted to play sports or do other activities that he didn’t think were appropriate for girls. I wish he had been more open-minded and encouraging of my interests."
441,"Couples of Reddit, what's the most unromantic thing that's happened between the two of you that actually is a stronger indication of love than others might think?","I had MRSA and my wound had to be packed with silver nitrate and wound tape to assure it didn't close over before healing.  

That meant my relatively new boyfriend was 2x daily putting me in agonizing pain and first pulling blood and pus soaked packing material out of a hole in my arm, he was then ruthlessly shoving clean materials  back in.  

I knew then he was the one.  We've been happily married over 10 years now.  ","My husband once took the garbage out in the middle of the night when I was feeling too tired and nauseous to do it myself. It was so unromantic and yet it meant so much to me that he was willing to do something so mundane for me. It was a small gesture, but it was a powerful indication of his love and commitment to me."
442,What's the weirdest thing you've seen happen at a friend's house that they thought was normal?,"When I was in high school, a friend asked me and two other friends to his house for dinner.  His mom served homemade bean soup, which was very good.  Toward the end of the main course, she brought out chocolate cake for dessert.  She cut each of us a slice and plopped it into our bowls... in which we each still had about an inch of soup.  Us guests exchanged puzzled glances, but the family dug right in, so apparently chocolate cake soaked in bean soup was an ordinary thing for them.","My friend's family had a tradition of going around the table and saying what they were grateful for before they ate dinner. The weird part was that they would all take turns saying what their pet cats were thankful for as if they could talk. Everyone at the table would take it seriously and say things like ""Fluffy is thankful for the new scratching post"" and ""Mittens is thankful for the extra treats."" It was definitely an odd experience but everyone seemed to take it in stride."
443,What is the scariest/creepiest theory you know about?,"That my mother-in-law keeps “accidentally” leaving things at my house because she is slowly moving in.

Edit: my mother in law is awesome.","The Mandela Effect is one of the scariest and creepiest theories out there.

2. In the Lord of the Rings universe, the logic behind the power of the Ring is not consistent. For example, the Ring's power to make people invisible is not consistent with what happens when Frodo puts it on. 

3. In the Star Wars universe, the logic behind the Force is muddled and often contradictory. For example, the Force is said to be both a power that binds the Star Wars universe together and a power that can be used to manipulate events. 

4. In the Marvel universe, the logic behind the Infinity Stones is confusing and often contradictory. For example, the Power Stone is said to be capable of destroying entire planets, yet it seems to have no effect on the characters in the films.

She was of course pretty shocked by the request and said ""are you sure? I promise you really, really don't want to smell it, I always make sure to hold my breath if I'm getting that close"" but he insisted and it was arranged.

The worst I’ve seen (just garbage, not counting stuff brought to the hazmat department):

- a freezer stuffed with a skinned, rotting, headless deer carcass. We nearly called the cops before we realized it wasn’t human.

- Used needles. The worst being a tie between “porcupine couch” and the lady who literally handed me a *paper bag* full of syringes she found during a park cleanup.

- large container of old crystallized picric acid. Bomb squad had to deal with that one.

The best:

- a high end laptop in perfect condition except for a tiny crack on the lcd panel. Easy DIY repair that took $40 and 5 minutes, thing would’ve cost $1.5K new

- enough brand new furniture to literally furnish my whole apartment 

- a high end military grade inflatable boat, brand new 

The weirdest:

- a 1st gen platelet counting machine, complete with weird tubes of bright green liquid and mercury. When I was prepping it for hazmat disposal I had to call the company that bought the company that made it for some info... they never digitized the records but the oldest repair tech still working was super excited because he remembered servicing them 50 years ago.

- coffin. No body, just the coffin. Couldn’t see anything wrong with it either.

- buckets of testicles (from a ranch) that had been sitting out in the summer heat for a week. Smelled so bad my coworker hurled. That’s not the weird part... the weird part is the guys *wanted their buckets back.* Do you know how bad it has to smell to make a garbage collector puke? And they wanted them back?!

- the $10k duffel bag. Lady came in super upset because earlier she threw out a duffel bag that she didn’t know her boyfriend kept cash in. Over $10,000 in cash. We never found the bag.

- 16 full size barrels of old vegetable grease some guy had saved up in his garage. He was planning to make a biodiesel car or something.

Edit: a lot of people are asking if we get to keep stuff. Officially, no. It’s not against the law as far as I know (except for illegal stuff like drugs), but it’s against our policy. However workers do salvage things... as long as it’s discreet and they’re not selling it, management doesn’t get involved. Selling stuff is a big no.

We don’t fight over stuff. In fact we’ll keep an eye out for things colleagues might need. Most of what we salvage is actually tools and stuff we use at the dump. I’ve also started a management approved program to give away free household products that would otherwise be hazardous waste (paint, oil, cleaners, etc). Some dumps also run thrift stores to divert materials from landfill, but we don’t have the space.","The best thing I have found thrown away was an old, vintage record player.

Now, the drop boxes were literal boxes in cubbies with a slot on the front and a lock on them that prevented them from being pulled out. The rack holding them was just a basic metal frame with about 5 rows of boxes. My T.A.'s box was somewhere in the middle of the shelf.

So I figured, ""I'm late anyways, why not take a chance?"" and slipped my assignment into the box below my T.A.'s box.

I got my assignment handed back a few weeks later than everyone else and it had a note from another T.A. scribbled on it that said ""Looks like this fell into my box by mistake.""

That’s what my husband said to me years ago when I blurted out my love for him a couple months into dating 😅

Guess he was right, though.","You could respond by saying something like, ""Thank you for sharing that, I appreciate it. I care about you deeply, but I'm not ready to say it back yet."""
481,"Blind gay people of Reddit, how did you know you were gay?","I am typing this for my gay blind friend. 

He said and I quote **""My cock is so fun to play with, I assume different ones would be too!""**","I didn’t know I was gay until I was in my late teens. I had already developed a strong attraction to other men, but I assumed I was just a very close friend. It wasn’t until I had a conversation with another gay friend that I realized I was gay. I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders and I was finally able to accept myself for who I was."
482,"Deaf people of Reddit, what is the equivalent of having a song stuck in your head?","I've been deaf since I was two. 

I always get clips of people dancing stuck in my head like the Carlton dance from Fresh Prince of Bel Air or  dancing in the fountain from the Friends theme song.","For me, it's having a sign stuck in my head. It's like I can't stop thinking about a certain sign or phrase and it just keeps repeating itself in my head. It can be a sign I know or something I've seen someone else sign. It's annoying, but it happens."
483,"How do you feel about a law stating that tickets (speeding, driving under influence etc.) should be a percentage of the perpetrators annual wage, instead of fixed rates?","Its worth noting that in the US, this has been tried/proposed several times in several jurisdictions and courts toss it out.  This is a *massive* simplification (bc the full explanation is super complicated), but in the US punishments must be clearly delineated (eg not arbitrary) in the statute and based on the crime itself, not on the perpetrator her/himself.  And to be clear - a judge has discretion to waive/reduce/etc due to hardship, but it really doesn't work the other way (eg, a judge can give you the 'max' but s/he can't just arbitrarily tack on a punishment higher that the statute permits b/c you are rich.)

EDIT to add: getting way too many replies to answer ppl, but here is something to think about: The 8th amendment plus the 14th amendment together prohibit punishments that are 'arbitrary.'  This means that when you are punished for a crime, there has to be a set penalty in place. This means that if two people commit the *exact* same crime under the *exact* same circumstance in the *exact* same jurisdiction, they would get the *exact* same punishment.  If a punishment was based on your income, you'd get two different outcomes - this is why these laws get tossed.  There's a famous quote I'm butchering that goes something like 'justice can never be served by the roll of the dice,' meaning different outcome for different people in identical situations isn't justice.

Another thing to consider - your income itself is *also* arbitrary.  On monday you're unemployed; the next day you take your last dollar and win the lottery; if you got a ticket monday, the punishment is $0 on tuesday your punishment is $$$$$ - with no change in the law itself; that's too arbitrary in the eyes of the law.  There are also several other challenges in the way of income-based fines, but the 8th plus 14th amendments are the big ones.

Final edit: there's a ton of ""but in Germany..."" or ""but in finland...""  or ""if it works in Europe, it can work here."" Other countries can do whatever they want; in the US we are bound by the US Constitution - there's not a lot of wiggle room short of 1) passing an amendment, or 2) pushing through a whole new interpretation of several amendments and getting a whole shit load of precedent reversed.  Good luck with that.","I think this is an interesting idea that could be effective in deterring people from committing certain traffic violations. It could be a good way to ensure that the punishment fits the crime, since the amount of the ticket would be based on the perpetrator's income level. However, I think it could also be difficult to implement and enforce, since it would require a lot of paperwork and tracking of the perpetrator's income."
484,"Divorce lawyers of Reddit, what is the most insane (evil, funny, dumb) way a spouse has tried to screw the other?","Had a client whose wife wanted him out of the house. I told him not to leave, just move to a different bedroom for the time being because once he was out the chances of him ever getting back in were slim. 

He texted his wife and told her he was staying in the house. She called back and left a VM that she wanted him out and if he wasn't out soon, she would start taking out her unhappiness on the children, and would remind the children that mommy was being mean to them because daddy wouldn't leave.","One of the most insane (and evil) things I have seen is when a spouse attempted to hide marital assets by transferring them to a third party, such as a relative or friend, in order to prevent the other spouse from receiving their fair share in the divorce. Unfortunately, the court found out about the scheme and the spouse was ordered to pay back the money plus interest."
485,What is the most effective psychological “trick” you use?,"I work in an office. When people stop by my desk and refuse to leave me alone I will get up and refill my water bottle while they are talking to me. Instead of walking back to my desk, I walk them to theirs. They instinctively will sit down. Then I just sever the convo and get back to work.

Edit: Holy shit this blew up. Thanks for the gold and silver kind internet peoples","The most effective psychological trick I use is reframing. Reframing involves looking at a situation from a different perspective and finding a way to interpret it in a more positive or helpful light. This can help to reduce stress, increase motivation, and improve problem-solving skills. For example, instead of thinking of a difficult task as an insurmountable obstacle, I might reframe it as an opportunity to learn something new or gain a valuable skill."
486,Does life actually get better? How do you come back/get better from being lonely and extremely depressed? How do you create meaningful relationships when you are so screwed up?,"You can't live a meaningful life in a day but you can have a slightly better day at a time. Strive towards having a better day first, start with one conversation, one relationship at a time. 
And give yourself time to grow and get results. Consistent effort is what it takes to be better","Yes, life can get better. It may take time, but it is possible. To come back from being lonely and depressed, it is important to focus on yourself and take steps to improve your mental and physical health. Start by engaging in activities that bring you joy such as hobbies, exercise, or time spent with friends. You might also consider joining a support group or seeing a therapist to help you process your feelings and work on your mental health.

In terms of creating meaningful relationships when you are feeling “screwed up,” it is important to remember that everyone is different and that you do not have to be “perfect” in order to form meaningful connections. Be open and honest with people about how you are feeling and talk to them about your struggles. This can help create a sense of understanding and trust between you and the other person. Additionally, try to find activities that you can do together and that bring you both joy. This can help you to build a strong bond and create meaningful relationships."
487,"How would you feel about a high school class called ""Therapy"" where kids are taught how to set boundaries and deal with their emotions in a healthy manner?","As a former high school student I can tell you 60% of them would not take it seriously.

EDIT: this is a rough estimate, depending on the class dynamic it could be anything between 100% of the class and like 50 I'd say. 
(The other way would be more realistic tho I feel like.)

EDIT2: If we use this comment section as a field experiment I've found that for every positive opinion on this subject there are 2-3 negative ones, so my estimate of 60% was slightly low. (Now, I know that reddit might not be the perfect testing grounds, but you have to agree that there is a clear trend here.)","I think it’s a great idea! Teaching kids how to set boundaries and cope with their emotions in a healthy way is a valuable life skill that will help them throughout their lives. It’s also important to normalize the idea of talking about and addressing mental health, so that kids feel more comfortable doing so."
488,"Medical professionals of Reddit, when did you have to tell a patient ""I've seen it all before"" to comfort them, but really you had never seen something so bad, or of that nature?","Years ago my then 11 year old shattered both femurs and her hip. At the time, her Orthopaedic specialist was so reassuring and confident that we had no doubts about her recovery.

A year later, we went back for a review and he asked me if I'd like to see her trauma x-rays. Not having any idea of the reality I said yes. What I saw looked like her leg bones had exploded. 

After my freaked out reaction I commented on how cool and calm he was, and how certain that she'd be fine. He said he'd actually had to go for a short walk around the hospital to collect his thoughts since he had no idea how he would put this child back together. He also told me had used the films as a teaching aid. He's one of my heroes.","I'm a physician assistant and I had a patient who had an extremely rare condition that caused her to have a large tumor on her face. She was so scared and embarrassed about the tumor, and I had to tell her that I had seen it all before to try to put her at ease. But truthfully, I had never seen anything like it before. I felt so bad that I couldn't offer her any more comfort than just reassuring her that I had seen it before."
489,What’s the most “I’m turning into my parents” moment for you?,I heard a loud noise and instantly got pissed off.,"The most ""I'm turning into my parents"" moment for me was when I found myself lecturing my teenage daughter about the importance of having a good work ethic and doing her best in school. It was a reminder that I was now the parent and that I was following in my parents' footsteps."
490,"People of Reddit who knew celebrities before they were famous, how different do they act now?","I live in the town where Dolly Parton grew up, and practically everyone above the age of 50 who grew up here claims to either be a distant relative of Dolly’s, or they claim to know her in some way. Everyone has their story of the time they met Dolly. It’s pretty obvious, but regardless of who you talk to, Dolly has always been sweet and generous, but everything has simply grown exponentially due to her fame. Examples are the millions of books she gives out for free to children around the globe each month, or how she gave out $10,000 cash to many of my close friends after their houses burned in a fire a couple years back. Thousands of people are employed here and work for one of the businesses she owns, and it’s a tad strange to see when you walk in, but the birthing center at the local hospital is funded by and named after her. I honestly can’t think of one person I know who doesn’t like her. Dolly’s heart has only gotten bigger because of fame.","I had a friend in college who was roommates with Zach Galifianakis before he was famous. He was the same person then as he is now, just without all the fame and attention. He was funny, kind, and humble, and he was still the same even after he became famous."

493,What item under $50 drastically improved your life?,"A foldable laptop stand for 15€. Always thought you didn’t need this stuff, how different from without one can it be - but it does wonders for my neck. Travels everywhere with me now.

Also: a 2m phone cable. It’s the shit.

Edit: good morning to a hundred comments. [This is the laptop stand](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0834VDRT6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1), seems it was cheaper because of Amazon Prime back in November, but I'd say 20€ is definitely still worth it. I like it because the dark gray metallic color matches my laptop and the aluminium material feels way sturdier than a plastic stand would. I chose a very slim model that's basically just a framework for the laptop, no table or anything, because I mainly need this to take up the least possible space in my backpack as I travel with it every day.

As I bought the cable a few years back, the original article isn't on Amazon anymore, but it was literally an Amazon Basics iPhone cable. Right now, they have to seem [these](https://www.amazon.de/AmazonBasics-Lightning-Kabel-Apple-Zertifiziert/dp/B07DC9SBLQ/ref=sr_1_4?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=amazon+basics+lightning+usb&qid=1610966404&sr=8-4) and [these](https://www.amazon.de/AmazonBasics-Verbindungskabel-Lightning-auf-USB-geflochten-zertifiziert/dp/B01F9RH0R4/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=amazon+basics+lightning+usb&qid=1610966404&sr=8-3), and I'm sure there are many others that will do their job just fine.","A programmable slow cooker.

494,what are the downsides of weed that people don't talk about ?,"As a pretty consistent weed smoker, I don’t like when people say that weed isn’t addicting. They’re right in saying that it’s not addictive chemically like nicotine or something, you can still get addicted to not being sober.","1. Respiratory Issues: Smoking marijuana can cause lung irritation, which can lead to chronic cough, bronchitis, and an increased risk of lung infections.

2. Reduced Cognitive Function: Long-term or heavy marijuana use has been linked to a decrease in cognitive functioning, including memory, concentration, and problem-solving abilities.

3. Addiction: Marijuana can be addictive, and some people can develop a psychological dependence on it.

4. Decreased Motivation: Some people who use marijuana regularly report feeling less motivated or having a lack of ambition.

5. Increased Risk of Mental Health Issues: Regular marijuana use has been linked to an increased risk of developing mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and psychosis."

She was used to being creative in ways to save money, such as making her own clothes and growing her own food.

498,"People with the last name Pepper who have doctorate degrees, what is your experience introducing yourself to people and do you wish you could change your name?","Fun fact, Dr Pepper was sued in the 1950s by a Dr. Clark Pepper, a proctologist from Houston, in an attempt to get them to change their name. His argument was that consumers would assume that he personally endorsed the beverage. The suit was not successful.

Owing to the rules of social decorum at the time, Dr. Clark Pepper was never referred to in court as a proctologist and instead euphemistically called ""a specialist in internal matters"".

Edit: Wow, you're all disgusting.","Introducing myself to people with my last name Pepper can sometimes be a bit awkward. People often make jokes about the name or assume I'm related to the famous actor. It can be a bit tiring to constantly explain the origin of my last name. While I don't wish I could change my name, I do sometimes wish that people would take me more seriously and not make assumptions about my background."
499,"What celebrity did bad things but everyone ""forgot"" what they did because they're famous?","George Wallace—the infamous pro-segregation Governor of Alabama in the 60s—did not inform his wife that her doctor diagnosed her with cancer (doctors during this time often told patient’s relatives of their cancer diagnosis instead of the patient, especially if the patient was female). The reason was that she was running for governor as a surrogate for him since he had reached his term limits and he thought that the diagnosis would negatively affect her chances of winning. She ended up finding out about it 4 years later during a visit to a gynecologist, but unfortunately the cancer had progressed to the point that she died from it 3 years after learning that she had cancer and that her husband had known about it. 

He ended up successfully getting the term limits repealed and went on to serve a few more terms as governor. People forget about this, I’m assuming, because of all of the other shitty things he did.

Edit: Her name was Lurleen Wallace, for those interested.","One example is Kevin Spacey. He was accused of sexual misconduct in 2017, but many people seem to have ""forgotten"" about it due to his fame."

502,What is the strangest thing you've seen that you cannot explain?,"When I worked in the medical field, I had a dream one night about a patient of mine, a very kind elderly woman, whom I visited once or twice a week. In the dream she came to me, dancing, and called out to me that she wasn't hurting any more. I was so happy watching her dance after seeing her decline for years. 
When I got to work the next morning, I told my coworkers about the dream and later that morning we got the call from her daughter that she had passed away the night before. I cannot explain that, but I am glad I had told my coworkers about it before the call and not after otherwise they'd never have believed me. Such a bizarre experience but so wonderful to feel she was at peace.","I once saw a large, black, cloud-like shape hovering in the sky for a few minutes before dissipating into nothing. I have no idea what it was or where it came from."
503,How do you control yourself when you are full of rage and want to keep calm?,"I'm a very calm person, but teach calming techniques to emotionally disturbed kids. 

The biggest help I've found is finding a technique which grounds you and reminds you where you are in the present. I teach lots of different ones, including: 

- clench and unclench your toes, focus on the feeling of your feet on the floor while you do it. 

- breath in and out so deeply you feel like your ribs are being pulled apart and knitted back together. 

- Grab something near you, could be a pole, table whatever, and clench and unclench around it. 

- Walk, while counting your steps. 

- Do something rhythmic, I like bouncing a ball personally but can be anything, from using a stamp to skipping. 

All research shows when you reach ""red mist"" your rationality is gone and you just have to last it out. Your best bet is to recognise when you're losing control and utilise grounding techniques before you're past the point of no return.

Edit: just to add the response to this has been amazing and I've tried to answer everyone who asked me a direct question. Please message me if I missed you! Also apparently I have to watch Die Hard?","1. Take slow, deep breaths.

Edit, 5 mins later than the first: HOLY CRAP THANKS FOR THE GOLD I NEVER REALIZED IT! Thank you, kind stranger!","No, I would not support a remake of Snakes on a Plane where innocent snakes are put in danger. It would be cruel and unnecessary to put animals in a dangerous situation for the sake of entertainment."
523,"What famous person has done something incredibly heinous, but has often been overlooked?",Steven Tyler got custody of his 14 year old girlfriend so she could go on tour with Aerosmith and be together. Her parents consented.,"Roman Polanski is one famous person who has often been overlooked for his heinous acts. In 1977, he was arrested and charged with drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty to the charge of “unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor” and was sentenced to prison, but he fled the country before the sentence could be carried out.

524,What's one of the dumbest things you've ever spent money on?,"Chef Boyardee beefaroni. One summer, because I was hella bored, I bought some chef Boyardee beefaroni and put it in my friend's mailbox as a prank. He didn't find it but his parents did, and they asked their neighbors who did it. He suspected me at first, but I managed to get him off of my tail. Now our neighborhoods were fairly close to eachother, so I could be over there in a 50 minute walk. Every night, I walked up to their neighborhood (walking anywhere at 2:am is creepy as hell but the Boyardee bandit does not stop for demons) and put a can of beefaroni inside their mailbox. After about a month, they call the police to find out who's putting beefaroni in their mailbox. Luckily the police really didn't care that much and just told them to get a camera which they eventually did. Meanwhile my friend is telling me all of this from his perspective, right, so I usually know what they do before I strike. So I start covering my face, and pretend to hunch over. I have no idea where this camera is, so I can never be too careful. They call the cops again and give them a profile, and now the cops are looking for a crippled beefaroni bandit. After a solid 3 months of this shit, one of the baggers at the store gets word somehow, and starts getting suspicious because he sees me buying tons of beefaroni. He confronts me, I tell him the truth, and I shit you not he starts helping me beefaroni my friend's house. We're putting it all over hiding it in the lawns, porch, fence, you name it. Halloween rolls around, and I dress up as chef Boyardee. I go to my friends house and say ""your daily subscription to Chef Boyardee beefaroni has ended. Would you like to renew?"". I hear laughter in the background, and it's the store clerk. Turns out he recently started dating best friend's sister, and that's how he heard. Truth be told, I don't think I've ever been punched harder than when my friend found out. Good times. We still laugh about it from time to time.

TLDR. Bought and hid chef Boyardee beefaroni for nearly half a year around my best friend's house. The Beefaroni bandit strikes again!",I once spent $30 on a mini-fridge for my dorm room that was incredibly loud and ended up breaking within a month.
525,"[Serious] Parents who have adopted a older child (5 and up), how has it gone for you? Do you regret it or would you recommend other parents considering adoption look into a older child?","My story is a bit different. I was coaching a soccer team and had a kid in the foster program on the team. He was 13. Over the course of the season my wife and I really got to know him and saw how shitty his foster parents were. At the end of the season we asked him if he wanted to come live with us instead. It’s been 9 years since then. 

We had rough patches, but for us it was easy. We were still a young couple (24 & 27) then but his social worker arranged continued funding for us which eliminated any financial burden. It was an easy decision for us and I’d do it again in a heart beat. We’ve had 4 of his other biological siblings live with us at one time or another as they’ve aged out of foster care. They all have their own unique problems, but all kids do. His 18 year old sister asked to come quarantine with us so we’ve got her staying here now. His brothers and sister are all just extra family and our biological little ones (3 & 5) call them all brother/sister. 

He’s 22 now and almost done with college and hopes to be a police officer. Sadly my wife and I will be moving out of state soon and we’ll miss him like crazy, but know we’ve prepared him for life outside our home. We’ll still be there for him of course, but we’re excited to see him thrive independently. His girl friend of 4 years is pushing him to move to our new state once they both finish school so they may still be back near us soon enough.","I adopted a 6 year old and the process was long and complex. It was difficult to get through the paperwork and the emotions that come with adoption. However, I don't regret it for a second. My daughter is now a happy 14 year old and she has been a joy to raise. I would definitely recommend other parents considering adoption to look into an older child. The process may be more difficult, but the rewards are high. Older children are more likely to remember their past and may be more emotionally mature, which can be a benefit in the long run."
526,What is the most inoffensive thing you've seen someone get offended by?,"One time someone got offended when I put on my seatbelt, thought I was commenting on her ability to drive.","I once saw someone get offended by a joke about a dog being called a pet.

We got it over 20 years ago, I don't remember where or why.  Maybe a halloween party?  Anyway.  My wife and I have been hiding it for each other ever since.  It could take months for Freddie to pop up but he always does.  She will find it burried in the sugar pot.  I will later find it inside a pair of shoes I rarely wear.  It often makes us jump, and give a small fright.  I'll hear my wife let a surprised gasp then go: ""Oh Freddie!"".

For me Freddie is a great symbol that our relationship is still solid after all these years, that we still take the time to have fun, to surprise each other.",My most important item in my home that has a value of $1 or less would be my house key. It represents the security and safety of my home and is invaluable.

We decided to take a walk before our parents picked us up, so we went along the canal towpath. My cousin looked down in the canal and say a really nice jacket floating along and being a weird scavenger person decided to reach in to fish it out.

Well, the jacket turned over. And so did the man wearing it. He also had no face left. 

Not gonna lie, that was rough.","The creepiest thing I have ever seen in the woods was a strange figure standing in the shadows. It was tall, with long, dark hair and a pale face. Its eyes seemed to be glowing in the darkness, and it seemed to be staring directly at me. I was so scared, I quickly ran away and never went back."
532,What is an underrated website everyone should know about?,"[this to that](www.thistothat.com) 

It’s a website to help you choose the best glue to use to glue two different materials together.

537,How would you feel if there was a reality show where flat-earthers have to find the edge of the world?,"It would fit perfectly in line with those reality tv History Channel shows where they treat everything they find like it's some big revelation but in the end  it's never anything of substance, ever. 

""I found a nail over here.""

Narrator's voice over: ""Could it be from a 16th century Spanish galleon?""","I would feel uncomfortable watching a reality show where flat-earthers are attempting to prove their theory by attempting to find the edge of the world. I think the show would be sensationalizing an idea that is not supported by scientific evidence, and I would find it difficult to watch."
538,"Which character death hit you differently, and why?",I definitely fucked up by going into this comment section with all these spoilers but thats on me,"The death of Ned Stark in Game of Thrones hit me differently than any other character death I have ever experienced. His death was so unexpected and sudden, and it was the first major death in the series that really shook me. It made me realize that no matter how beloved a character is, they can still be killed off and that anything can happen in a story. Ned's death also had a major impact on the storyline, making it clear that no one was truly safe in the world of Westeros and that the stakes of the story were higher than ever."

540,People who can express themselves clearly and make themselves understood whenever you open your mouth: How the hell do you do that?,"I was going to say ""make sure you use the right words"" but actually it's ""make sure you use the right words for the right audience"". Not everyone is at the same level of comprehension, so knowing what works for who is one huge hurdle to get over first.","The best way to express yourself clearly and make yourself understood is to practice active listening. This means paying close attention to what others are saying, and then paraphrasing back what you heard to ensure you understand what they said. Additionally, it’s important to communicate your thoughts in a clear and concise manner. This means using language that is easy to understand and avoiding overly complex words and phrases. Finally, be sure to use non-verbal communication such as body language to help convey your message."

With my luck, they would load me into the matrix and the system would throw an error and have to be rebooted.","I would not do it. While the idea of living worry-free in a simulated environment has some appeal, I value my autonomy and freedom too much to give up my body and organs at such a young age. Additionally, I think it's important to experience life in its fullest, with all its ups and downs, and I don't think a simulated environment would be able to provide that."

My teacher (a woman) told the man that her husband was away on a business trip and to call back the next day. 

He called the next day, again asking for the man of the house, and she informed him that her husband had  been delayed and to call back the next day. He called the next day, and she informed him that due to bad weather his flight had been delayed until later on that night, so please call back the next day.

Edit 2: obligatory thank you for the gold and silver. But please, instead kick that money to your favorite cancer research charity ... and maybe one with not a ridiculously high overhead if you all know what I mean.","My go-to song is ""Hurt"" by Johnny Cash.

When she got to work she had this terrible feeling something was wrong with him. She ended up leaving work and drove to the daycare. She found the daycare lady inside sleeping while the daycare kids (including my brother) were running around the pool. My brother never went back to that daycare again.,"About a year ago, I was walking through a park late at night. I had an eerie feeling that someone was following me, but I couldn't see anyone.

It was definitely my gut feeling that saved me that night."

In 150 years who the hell is gonna even believe I'm still alive?,"My plan would be to use my immortality to my advantage, and use my skills and knowledge to become financially independent.

551,Which fictional character's death have you not gotten over?,"Boromir.

When I first watched LOTR, I couldn't have cared less when Boromir died. He was arrogant, not as cool as anyone else, and dangerously drawn to the ring.

However, as I've gotten older, I find myself connecting with Boromir more with every watch. He clearly cares deeply for the other members of the fellowship. Unfortunately, he also feels the weight of responsibility for his people, and the pressure from his father. The ring fed into that tortuous quandry, and nearly drove him mad.

The scene where he comes to his senses after driving Frodo off is heartbreaking now. So, so horrified at what he'd done. So vulnerable, so human. And despite believing that he had doomed the world, he threw himself into protecting that which he could still reach, the other hobbits. Everything he had, including his life. And his last moments with Aragorn, oof. The love and pride that bursts from him.

Boromir is a great character.",I still haven't gotten over the death of Sirius Black in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

This was in Southern California...  Where there is ABSOLUTELY ZERO risk of a gas shortage.",Things are much better now! Most gas stations have been able to restock and the lines are much shorter. Prices have also returned to normal in most areas.
554,There's a minimum age for certain political jobs. How would you feel if there was a maximum age limit?,"The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 would prevent any legislation on age caps for any jobs, but oddly enough, if you are under 40 you are not covered by this anti-discrimination law.  I find it odd that an anti discrimination law would so very clearly discriminate on the very thing it aims to prevent discrimination on.","I would feel uncomfortable with a maximum age limit for political jobs. I believe that experience and wisdom should be valued regardless of age, and that a person's age should not be a barrier to their career. Furthermore, I believe that age discrimination should be avoided at all costs, as it can be damaging to an individual's self-esteem and sense of worth."

It turned out to be a great decision. I'm now working in a field I love and I'm very happy with my life. It's not quite the same as pursuing my dream, but it's a great career and I'm content with it.

Reddit would need to significantly increase the number of servers and bandwidth available to meet the increased demand.

I don't. That's my mother. 

Also: since my Mom and I are only 16 years apart, we ended up liking a lot of the same music. Which made going to concerts a lot easier, because we'd often wanna go to the same shows. So, I've definitely seen a lot more bands than friends.","The life of a child born to a teen mom can be very different from the life of other kids. Depending on the circumstances, they may face unique challenges such as poverty, lack of access to educational and social opportunities, and limited support from family and friends. They may also have to deal with stigma and judgments from others. On the other hand, some children of teen moms grow up to be successful and happy adults. Ultimately, the differences in life between these kids and other kids will depend on the individual circumstances, support systems, and resources available to each child."

I miss seeing the sun rising above them or the fog rolling through. I used to wonder about the people who lived in the gigantic houses high up on them and wondered what they saw in that moment. Every time I go there now it’s in the afternoon and it’s still pretty, but there’s less intimacy.","People who don't wake up early miss out on the peacefulness of the morning, the opportunity to start their day with a clear head, and the chance to get a head start on their tasks for the day."

566,"People who work at a subway/sandwich place, what is the strangest order you've ever had from a customer?","I worked at a Subway for a couple months after high school. While working there I had a very polite customer, who was pregnant at the time, come in every other week or so and order the same footlong ham sandwich. What made this sandwich so strange was that she would ask for a tonne of black olives. Like MULTIPLE, whole handfuls of black olives. So much, that it was hard to close up and wrap the sandwich without some olives spilling out. 

Some of my coworkers would only give her so much before they refused to add more. There were no rules, to my knowledge, stating a limit on the amount of black olives a customer could request, so I always obliged. Knowing this, she would refuse help from my coworkers and wait for me to make her footlong black olive sandwich. She would always comment that it was something she started ordering after becoming pregnant and it was the baby that wanted the olives. 

Some time had passed where I didn’t see her come in anymore. Until one day, I see her walk in with a stroller and her brand new baby daughter. She brought her in so I could meet the “olive baby”. She thanked me for all the times I made her olive sandwich just the way she liked it and then proceeded to order a ham sandwich. Only this time, she asked for just a few olives. 

I quit a short time after but I still think about that sandwich and the olive baby from time to time.","The strangest order I've had was from a customer who wanted a sandwich with just mayonnaise and tuna. No bread, no vegetables, no condiments - just a scoop of mayo and tuna on a plate."

598,Teachers of reddit what is the most depressing thing a student has told you about their home life?,"I kept having this kid come and sleep in the 1st period. I mean that’s normal for high school. One day I made pancakes as a treat and the kid didn’t sleep, they ended up staying up and ate 6 pancakes. 
Later the kid told me they often don’t eat breakfast because their parents don’t buy food. When they have extra money it goes to buying alcohol. After hearing that I went and bought Breakfast foods and left them out for anyone to take. The kid didn’t sleep after that.

Edit: I didn’t think this would blow up. But I wanted to clarify, the parents didn’t qualify for food stamps or any help because they made too much money. At least it looked like they did on paper but really they didn’t. I lived in the Bay Area  at the time and even though they made a lot, most the money went to rent it living expenses. They also generally seemed to make bad choices, not judging them but it seemed kids came last often.
I think one thing that came from the pandemic that is good is the free food that many schools are handing out. It’s wonderful to see. In the past our district would still offer meals in the summer to any kid under 18 who showed up to summer school even if not attending.

Continued: someone mentioned these parents should be judged. I agree they sound horrible. But one thing I keep in mind when working with kids is trauma is multi generational. We don’t know what impacted these  parents to behave this way. 
Personally, my mother grew up very poor and in abusive home. Her parents had gone through the Holocaust and it really impacted them. They didn’t know how to be parents and struggled with mental health issues in a time that didn’t  really provide support/ had negative stigma of mental health. So this trauma was passed on to my mom. My mom was a good mom but wasn’t always there for us emotionally because of her own attachment style she developed from her parents. So the trauma was passed on to us. 
Now that I am a parent I have to work super hard not to pass on the negative things I learned from my parents but changing behavior can be hard. 
I am not making an excuse for this kids parents. Something I learned while studying psychology ( my BA is psychology) is trauma passes through generations. 
I had a teacher once say something I always keep in mind when working with students: kids can impact and change parents behavior. Parents behavior and personality can change because of the child as well. Not saying this kid lead the parents to drink but rather having a kid who has special needs, doesn’t bond with you the way you wanted  or doesn’t behave how you expected them to can really impact you as a person.

Edit 2: yes I reported these parents. I called cps on them several times. I reported this to school admin, I talked to the school psych about this, I gently talked to the parents about this as well. Judging a parent isn’t helpful, but helping and educating a parent is what is needed. If the system fails we can only do so much. So if it takes spending $6 bucks on a bag of pancake mix every month I can do that. Sometimes we have to have short term goals to meet before we can fix the long term ones. So if just giving the kid food when hungry helps I will do it while we work on fixing the bigger issue. 
When I started to feed the kids breakfast I partly did it with this one kid in mind but I realized it wasn’t just this kid who came to school hungry. Teens have sleeping issues and sometimes they don’t get up early enough for breakfast. Some people can’t sleep till 3 am, some kids have horrible anxiety and they are up all night and can’t sleep, heck I bet a lot of those kids I worked with where simply not morning people and getting up to go to school sucked for them. I saw kids who came from good homes come to school hungry because something other than neglect caused it (though in this case it was neglect don’t get me wrong). 
All I am saying is we can’t judge a parent, we sometimes have to find a fast solution while fixing the bigger picture.","One student told me that his father was an alcoholic and he was often physically and verbally abused when he was drunk. He said that his father would often take away his video games and other possessions as punishment, leaving him feeling isolated and alone. He also said that his mother was often too scared to intervene or help him in any way. It was heartbreaking to hear and I could tell he had been carrying this weight for a long time."

It was an honors algebra/geometry class, and it was well known that Mr D re-used the same questions every year, just changed the numbers. He made a big deal about making sure we all gave our exam papers back to him after we had looked at our scores and gone over everything together to prevent cheating for the next year. 

Well, of course, some of my classmates got their hands on a complete set of tests from the previous year. Soon, everyone had a set. Before each exam, we would sit together and make sure we knew how to solve every problem on that test so we could do it on the real exam with different numbers. 

Years later, when I became a teacher myself, I saw Mr D at a funeral. I confessed to him that this is what we used to do. He smirked and said “Who do you think leaked the test packet to get you to study?” Mr D had figured out that kids won’t study if the teacher suggests it, but if they think they’re getting away with something, they totally will, so he managed to get a test packet out and circulating as contraband. Blew my mind. ","One of the most creative ways of cheating I have seen was when a student had memorized the entire test before they took it. They had done this by studying with a friend who had already taken the test. They had memorized the questions and answers and were able to recall them during the test. It was impressive, but not very ethical."

He was sitting on the stairs just like people do - on his butt, with his little feet sticking out, and in his hands was an honest to God subway 6 inch, still in the paper but slightly unwrapped, just like people eat it. It was like he was a tiny person in an opossum suit. There was just something so human like about everything he was doing. We stood there for what felt like ages watching this opossum eating, and trying to figure out what to do. No way were we going to risk walking past him..

Plus archeology's not just graves!","The answer to this question depends on the context and definition of the terms. Generally speaking, archaeologists are focused on the scientific study of past human cultures, while grave robbing is the illegal excavation and theft of artifacts from graves and archaeological sites. Therefore, time does not need to pass before grave robbing turns into archaeology, as they are separate activities."

637,What are you boycotting till the day you die?,"Lifetime Fitness.  It really pains me to write this, because I really love their gyms.  I had a membership at Lifetime on and off through college.  I went to a very large university with great amenities, so I didn’t need the membership during the school year.  I tried to cancel at the end of one summer.  I was at the gym one day and I asked about cancellation.  I was told to come back at a certain time frame the following Wednesday to cancel.  I complied.  When I showed up the “person doing the cancellations wasn’t there.”  I was told to return the following Wednesday.  Surprise, surprise, the person wasn’t there again.  I told them I was going to stop the payment through the credit card company.  They responded by telling me that they’d take me to collections then.  I ended up escalating through their corporate offices to get the membership cancelled.  They managed to get 2 extra months of fees out of me.  After that year of college, I shifted over to LA Fitness, and maintained that membership for about 10 years.  When I moved away from LA Fitness, I joined the YMCA, where I’ve been for the last 5-6 years.  I will always have a gym membership, but I am committed to not joining a Lifetime Fitness again until am reimbursed.  It’s really a loss for both of us.

Edit: Thanks for the awards everybody!  I can’t believe the attention this has received.  It seems that many of you have found yourselves in similar situations.

YMCAs are unique in that their membership cost structure is designed to subsidize memberships for individuals and families that otherwise could not afford one.

Goofy turned around to greet the child and signed his autograph book, and then turned to the mom, and slipped up his sleeve to quickly point at his own black skin underneath before walking away.

[EDIT:  A few people commented that this isn’t how the costume works, and that the sleeves aren’t possible to pull up under the gloves.  It could be a baloney story, but this is just what I heard from my friend who worked at Disney, alongside a bunch of our other classmates from our performing arts school at the time.]","Yes, there have been situations where I have had to break character. The most common reason I have had to break character is when a guest has asked for a photo with me or asked me a question that I am not allowed to answer. In these situations, I have to explain to the guest that I am not allowed to answer their question or take a photo with them. The consequences for breaking character are typically a verbal warning from a manager."

664,"What was your 'F*** it, done helping others' moment?","Had a friend years ago who was a bit self centered & prone to stretching the truth, but he was a nice enough guy with a rough backstory and my friend group liked him, so I cut him a lot of slack.

I like to host and I have friends staying over pretty regularly -- back then, I usually had one or two people spending the night on any given day.

Anyhow, over the span of a couple of years this guy starts abusing that -- staying over for days or even weeks at a time, eating my food and drinking my liquor without contributing, that sort of thing ... While constantly talking about his grand plans and day dreams as if they'd already happened. A little sad, but also pretty annoying after a while.

Anyhow, I sit him down one day and let him know he's gotta head home, and that he's free to come over and hang out but I'm not comfortable with him staying over for the time being. He leaves, I think it went remarkably well and head out to work...

...and it turns out that he broke in while I was away at work and stole a bunch of my sister's things because ""his birthday was coming up and neither of us even thought to get him a gift.""

It takes a special person to rationalize how *burglarizing someone is really their fault*. 

Anyway, all slack and sympathy went out the window immediately ... Called the cops and he's dead to me.","My ""F*** it, done helping others"" moment came when I realized that I was giving too much of my time and energy to helping others without taking the time to take care of myself. I was constantly exhausted and felt like I was not getting anything out of helping others, so I decided to focus more on my own needs and goals."

668,Stephen Covey said “Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.” What are your thoughts on this?,"There was a workplace seminar exercise thing I went to where we had to listen to our conversation partner, and all we have to do is to summarize what they said to make them feel fully understood. No response of our own other than reiterating their points. Then they have to “judge” us based on whether we got their main points, or if we’re missing important parts, or if we added anything they didn’t say. Took quite a bit of effort because we’re so used to just listening for keywords while our minds go elsewhere.

Edit: it’s called “active listening” as a few commenters mentioned. Great exercise!","I think this is a very true statement. We live in a world where it is often more important to be heard than to truly listen and understand. When we don't take the time to really listen to what someone is saying, we miss out on the opportunity to build a meaningful connection with that person. Listening with the intent to understand is a skill that can be developed, and it is one of the most important elements of effective communication."

EDIT: In response to the feedback about using services like this to get past ads- yes, I totally understand that it’s technically stealing.

Here’s my reasoning.

1. I don’t do it with every recipe, just the really egregious ones (some will automatically scroll you back to the top of the page if you lock your phone). 

2. The alternative to bypassing ads and preamble, is closing the page and looking for another recipe. I’m not going to run myself through a gauntlet of bullshit just to make chicken nuggets. I’ll find another source that found a healthy balance for ad space. I will accept ads if they aren’t intrusive/obnoxious or worse. If content creators want to run ads, great, no problem with that at all, but they should consider the user experience with how those ads are implemented into their content.",The website I wish more people knew about is called 'WikiHow'.

Saved enough to get a crappy apartment and just kept going from there.","The first night without a home was definitely a shock and difficult to adjust to. I felt scared, alone and uncertain of what the future held. I was used to having a roof over my head and a place to cook and sleep comfortably. I had to quickly adapt to sleeping outside or in shelters, often without access to basic amenities. I had to cope with the insecurity of not knowing where I would be able to sleep the following night or if I would have enough food for the day. I had to learn to be resourceful and figure out ways to survive on limited resources. It was a difficult, but ultimately rewarding experience that has taught me resilience and the importance of helping others in need."

681,What’s your childhood mystery that you finally solved years later?,"I met my wife in college and when we were dating she often mentioned that when she was a kid she had a play doctor’s kit that was stolen from her house. She had some surgeries really young and so her parents bought it for her to demystify the doctors office. She’d use it all the time on her dad poking and prodding him. 

One day I asked her about the robbery. Did they take everything? Jewelry? The TV? Other valuables? No, no, and no. It hit me. 

I asked “so, someone broke into your house and only stole your doctor’s kit, leaving anything worth fencing there?”

“Yeah, why?”

“Did you ever consider your folks were tired of you using the kit on them all the time after you got better?” 

“Oh, damn.” 

We confirmed it with her Dad later but for 15 years she had believed some thief broke in and ONLY stole her beloved doctor’s kit.

Edit: spelling","My childhood mystery that I finally solved years later was why I had always been so afraid of thunderstorms.

Since r/funny has the most subscribers of any sub I checked (26M), I bet the first post to hit 1M will be on r/funny in several years when they’ve hit at least 66M subscribers, and it will make you begrudgingly exhale from your nose.","It's impossible to predict when a Reddit post will hit 1 million upvotes for the first time, as the popularity of the post will depend on a variety of factors.

Well, eventually the homeowner did noticed and couldn't figure out where his food was going, so he set up a hidden camera to record it.

It's not something you really appreciate until you get older and start to notice kids around you that have to deal with some pretty fucked up shit from their parents. It's kind of slowly realizing how many bad things you've just never had to worry about thanks to your support system.

When they slowly start treating you like a fellow adult, and you get to see them as more of a whole person.","Having loving parents is wonderful. They provide unconditional love and support, and always put your best interests first.

At this point my curiosity has overridden my fear. I'm the guy in the horror movie who dies first because I just gotta know. Either I die or I get a cool story, right?

So I hop out of the car, and slowly walk up to it. I'm right in front of it and still can't understand what I'm seeing.

So I reach out and touch it.

It's a balloon. 

One of those foil birthday balloons with the streetlights shining on it making it look weird out of context in the middle of the night on an empty road.","The scariest thing I've ever seen while driving at night was a large animal running across the road in front of me. It was almost pitch black outside, and the animal was so big that it was hard to tell what it was. I was terrified that it might be a bear or some other dangerous creature, so I quickly veered off the road and stopped until it was out of sight."
714,What's the dumbest thing you actually believed?,"As a kid, my sister told me that we had an older brother that died. She said he died when playing bowling and his fingers didn't come out the ball and slid all the way down the alley then he turned into a skittle.","When I was a child, I believed that if I wished hard enough, I could make things happen."

717,"People who had considered themselves ""incels"" (involuntary celibates) but have since had sex, how do you feel looking back at your previous self?","I never really considered myself an Incel at the time (mostly because I'd never heard the phrase) but I was very incelly in highschool, I was the type of person who would hold a door open and then wonder why girls weren't falling into my lap.

Turns out highschool me wasn't that attractive and ""nice"" isn't a personality. I fell very much into the Chad's n stacey's frame of mind for a while.

A lot of things changed really, but mostly I just grew up. It's a super childish view of things and just doesn't take into account that the people around you are...well people.

If someone held a door open for you, you wouldn't throw yourself at them. It's about the maturity in relationships.


But seriously Fuck highschool me, proper cunt","I feel a mixture of embarrassment and shame for how much I let my incel identity define me. I realize now that my feelings of loneliness and inadequacy were really just a result of my own insecurities and fear of rejection. Once I started to open myself up to the possibility of intimacy, I found that I could actually have meaningful and fulfilling relationships. Looking back, I wish I had given myself more credit and not let my incel identity hold me back."
718,"Will you continue to wear a mask when the pandemic is over? If so, why?","Nevermind masks, how will I go back to wearing bras is my dilemma.","Yes, I will continue to wear a mask when the pandemic is over.

720,"What is NOT a bullet you dodged, but a huge tactical nuke you dodged?","In UNI me and my 2 best friends were drinking, playing Mario kart and just shooting the sh*t. We were hungry and wanted food. I said let's just make a tombstone pizza because we've been drinking and most delivery services were closed at 1:30AM. One said he's fine to drive, I said no no bad idea. He got the other guy to go with. McDonald's usually doesn't take 2 hours to get so eventually I went for a scooter ride since mcdonalds was less than 2 miles away. I notice there's a taped off spot on the bridge right before mcdonalds with a crane, cops and an ambulance. They curbed the car and drove it off the bridge and into the shallow creek top first and died on impact. I dodged the nuke of death but ate the bullet of survivors guilt for nearly 5 years.

Edit: whoa was not expecting all the upvotes, awards and positive feedback. Thank you everyone who read this and felt something because life is tough and you never know when it's the time. Have a nice day and thank you all!

Edit: Based off the comments I guess I have a few things to add 1) I am doing good, depression and fear of driving lasted a pretty long time. Moving back home for 2 semesters helped a lot versus being alone in the college apartment we shared. 2) it's those old Razor scooters that you kick, not a moped or electric scooter. 3) I took the keys of the driver but he had a spare key and they left when I went to the bathroom. Got to the living room and they were gone, looked out the window and his car was gone. Verbally said fu*k what an idiot, his dad is going to be livid if he gets pulled over.","A bullet is a small projectile fired from a gun, while a tactical nuke is a nuclear weapon.

723,What’s a book everyone should read at least once in their lives?,[deleted],"One book that everyone should read at least once in their lives is To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.

His refusal to condemn the white nationalists and his defense of some of those who were present was a clear sign to me that he was not fit to be President. His continued attacks on the press, his disregard for the rule of law, and his lack of empathy for those affected by the pandemic further confirmed my decision to not vote for him."

738,What was the weirdest thing the weird kid did at school?,"A kid I grew up with started wearing home made chain mail to school our freshman year of high school. Every day. For all 4 years. 

He was always pretty odd, but he was nice enough. Plus we had a few classes together thru middle school and we had connected over a shared love of a few videogames, so I felt comfortable asking him why he started wearing it all of the sudden. 

He proceeded to explain the defensive benefits of chain mail vs. both sharp and blunt instruments of harm. For like 5 solid minutes. Daggers. Pikes. Hammers. Even how curved blades like katana and falchions would struggle against it! 

I basically just shrugged and told him ""I mean, makes sense."" And we both went to our classes. 

I don't know what I expected, but I guess it wasn't the basic defensive benefits that armor offers.

Edit: Wow, thank you all! This is a much more widespread phenomenon than I had thought! This all took place in Wyoming (before it ceased being) for all the people wondering if it was their own knightly scholar.

Edit 2: I believe he wore an undershirt, then armor and then an over shirt. The armor was about 55lbs (I think) and it had a full hood (widows peak and all) and sleeves. This was in the 2000's so school shootings were definitely a thing, but not quite a weekly event, yet (yay America!). Also, I'm not gonna say his name, like I said, he was always nice and I'm not about to dox an old homie. Plus Wyoming has like 35 people in it, so... yeah...

I also was not trying to shame him at all, I think it was way cool and creative. Like the thread may suggest, a little weird, but I absolutely applaud the ingenuity to craft it all himself, so I don't want anyone who reads this to think I was shaming or bullying.

If you want to make chainmail for school or work or church or whatever, hell yeah, lil homie, be your own beautiful self! All love on this end!","That's a tough one to answer since it really depends on the specific kid and what they consider to be weird. However, some examples of weird behavior could include talking to themselves, wearing strange clothes, talking about strange topics, or engaging in strange activities."

740,"If covid 19 became a pandemic in 1990 rather than 2020, how would events have played out differently?",X-men cartoon telling you to wear a mask during cartoon time.,"If covid 19 became a pandemic in 1990 rather than 2020, the world would have been much less prepared to deal with it. In 1990, the internet was not widely available, so it would have been much harder to spread information about the virus and track its spread. Additionally, medical technology was not as advanced as it is today, so treatments and vaccines would likely have been less effective. Furthermore, the global economy was far less interconnected in 1990 than it is today, meaning the economic impact of the pandemic would have been much more localized. Governments would have had to rely on traditional methods such as quarantines and travel restrictions to contain the virus. Finally, due to the lack of technology and communication networks, it is likely that the virus would have spread further and caused more deaths than it did in 2020."

[Why is the large bread cheaper than the small bread in Houston?](https://imgur.com/a/BmybA)

It's the exact same bread.  Same ingredients, same taste, same size slices, everything.  The **only** differences are:

- The ""Large"" is longer (more slices).

- The ""Large"" is less expensive.

That's it.

This is the case in every grocery store I've seen in Houston: Kroger, Randall's, Target, even Wal-Mart.  The small bread is always more expensive and has been for years.

There is no conceivable reason anyone should be buying the small bread here.  Even if you kept your bread in an oddly short bread basket, it would be cheaper to just buy the large loaf and throw out a few slices.

And don't say it's something about scale.  That doesn't add up.  If it was cheaper to produce the large loafs, then they'd stop producing the small loaves.  It's the exact same bread.

**The.  Exact.  Same.  Bread.**

756,[SERIOUS] What is a seemingly normal photo that has a disturbing backstory?,"If you're British, and of a certain age, you'll probably be as haunted by [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/62/Bulger_cctv.jpg) grainy image as I am. I still distinctly remember the first time I saw it. At the time, James Bulger was only missing, and it was regarded as a cause for optimism that he was last seen with other children. The truth was [far worse than anyone imagined,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger) and still inspires a visceral reaction unlike any other crime in my lifetime.","One photo that comes to mind is the ""Migrant Mother"" photo taken in 1936 by photographer Dorothea Lange. It depicts a destitute woman in a moment of desperation, holding her two children and looking off into the distance. The backstory is that the woman was a migrant farm worker during the Great Depression. She had just lost her husband and was struggling to feed her seven children."

My friend worked in a pen factory for 3 years so I called him.
""It's...... Satisfying.  It's hard to describe.  If I had to find an equivalent it's like sticking your hand into a bowl of uncooked rice, but smoother and more satisfying.""","It can feel quite strange and even a little uncomfortable to immerse your hand into a bucket of ball pen balls. The sensation is similar to dipping your hand into a pile of small, slippery marbles. It can be a bit of a shock to the system, and it takes some getting used to."
759,What awesome holiday gift did you get someone that you can’t tell them about yet but want to brag about?,"My brother's been saving to take a course abroad next year. It's a huge deal for him and a game changer career wise (I don't fully understand why or the details but he's been saving for a year, sold his car and stuff so it's a huge deal for him). He's supposed to have the money to pay everything before December 30th.

When he goes to pay, he'll find out it's already paid. 

Best part is he gets to believe, for a week, all he's got from me is a pair of socks.

Edit: Wow! I didn't expect this reaction. Thanks everyone for the awesome comments and for the awards. This community is truly amazing! 

I thought I'd provide more information here to try and answer some of the questions :)

We live in Brazil and he's going to the UK for a year and a half. 

He'll be taking his masters there for a year and a half. This has been a goal of his for a while and, according to him, will help him get a good job in a larger company in one of the capitals. We live in a small town, not a lot of options for someone in his line of work.

As to why he's been saving for a whole year, we're in Brazil. Exchange rate is 1 GBP to 5.47 BRL. That alone is quite the challenge. 

He's been saving for tuition + accommodation for the first two months and is paying through a local travel agency. The owner is a close personal friend, so I'm not very worried about him paying twice.

To everyone worried about the car, he was going to sell it anyways. It doesn't make any sense to keep it stored for a year. Cars are quite expensive in Brazil, so yeah, he was going to use the money towards the trip. Now he can use it to explore.

Oh, and I'll post an update here once he finds out :)

Edit: UPDATE

So he got the socks! He has until the 30th to pay for the course so he hasn't found out yet but he did his best to look happy with the socks 😂😂 It was pretty clear he was disappointed though!

I will need to travel back home tomorrow so I won't be around to actually see his face when he finds out. But I am sure he's gonna call / text so I'll post an update with the reaction :)

Edit: UPDATE

He found out!! And as promised here's an update on the reaction.

He called me and he was crying :) He said he called our father to ask if he could borrow a couple grand to be able to make the payment today and my dad told him it had been paid already. He couldn't believe it.

He kept saying thank you and that he hopes some day he can pay the gesture back. I told him he more than did already. He was there for me everytime I needed. He went out of his way to pull me out of the gutter when I was down. I was always able to rely on him. 

He cried. I cried. 

We talked about the UK, about his plans for the future and decided that, now that he has spare money to explore Europe, we'll take a trip together next summer.

I wish I had been there when he found out. 

Thank you everyone for your kind words in the comments.",I got them a trip to a tropical destination!

She was barking and going from window to window. They finally let her out as he was walking up the steps to the porch. She ran up to him all excited until she saw it wasn't her master. It was like someone had kicked her. The tail went under and she slowly walked over to her bed and laid down in her sadness.","My pet cat was a bit confused at first when she saw two of me.

You at least need to check out

[**Kenshi**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/)

I am not kidding - this game took twelve years to make and was finally released a couple of weeks ago.

The map is the size of the Isle of Wight.

It's a *real* sandbox, and you can play whatever kind of game you want to play in it.

Farm cactus and make rum. Set up a world-class weapon production house. Make and sell clothing. Or hashish. Or bandanas. Build a town. Roam around with your band of tame goats. Fight the holy empire. Free the slaves. Buy the slaves. Capture people and sell them as slaves. Journey through the most imaginative and gorgeous terrain I've ever seen.

I have well over 900 hours in it. It's a fucking masterpiece.

Bonus trivia: There are some places in the swamps where you'll run across guys in villages selling drugs and fish, the two most common local products. It's the only game I've ever seen where walking past an NPC can prompt them to call out

**""High on drugs? Buy some delicious fish!""**

***Edited to add:*** *There's this thing called Early Access and beta versions, for anyone else who thinks I might be pretending that I've played 900 hours of a game in the last two weeks.*

Final edit: apologies if I didn't get around to answering your question - I'm sorry, there were hundreds and I had to turn off inbox replies because a surprising amount of people haven't heard of Early Access and/or are *super* upset that I really like this game. Sometimes blocking ain't enough. The game's great, check some of the fantastic replies that others have left on it, there's some good humans in this thread. Party on, dudes.","My 2018 video game recommendation of the year is God of War. This critically acclaimed action-adventure game is set in a Norse mythology-inspired world, and features an emotionally gripping story, intense combat, and stunning visuals. It's a must-play for any fan of the genre."

It's not a huge deal, and it's usually just a way for them to save face."

812,Do you think landlords should be open to being lenient on rent in a crisis like this (pending proof of lack of employment)? Why/why not?,"My rent was due to go up $100 this month, just got a notice on my door that due to the coronavirus, the owner of the property is delaying the increase for 2 months. It's not anything spectacular but it's something and I appreciate it.","Yes, I think landlords should be open to being lenient on rent during a crisis like this. It is a difficult and uncertain time for many people, so it is important to be understanding and to provide assistance where possible. Additionally, it is important to recognize that people may be struggling to make ends meet and that leniency on rent may be the difference between someone being able to remain in their home or not."

I tried to find him during office hours and he wasn’t available. I told him that I deserved an extra 5 points because he wasn’t available when he said he would be and he gave it to me in the interest of fairness","When I was in high school, I had a teacher who, on the first day of class, made it a point to learn every student's name and make us feel welcome in the classroom. That small gesture made me instantly respect her and know that she was dedicated to her job."
815,"(Serious) The UK has left the European Union, if you voted Brexit, why? How will it benefit you personally?","I voted Leave during the referendum, and whilst I stand by my reasons for this initial vote, I came to change my view over the course of the absolute nightmare that has been Brexit.

When I voted, it was primarily because of the federalisation of the EU. I am not opposed to this in principle, but I have never been very convinced by how the European government is structured. In particular I was concerned that the European Parliament votes on legislation and cannot *propose* new legislation; they can only debate and amend legislation put forth to them by the European Commission. I believed, and still believe, that there is a fundamental democratic deficit in the European Union and that full integration into a supranational quasi-federation would not be desirable whilst such a deficit exists.

(I feel that the EU *needs* to either fully federalise  or draw back into a looser confederation. The half-and-half state it currently in does not feel robust or stable enough to be properly efficacious)

I was very torn when it came time to vote. I have never considered myself ""european"", and as stated above I had a lot of reservations about the EU; but I also recognised the advantages of membership. At the time I believed that federalisation was inevitable if the EU was to survive and so long as major reforms were not put in place - reforms I had despaired of ever occurring - then I felt the UK would be drawn into what would in essence be a federal oligarchy.

When I voted, I made a number of erroneous assumptions about how the Brexit process would unfold which tipped my hand in favour of Leave and which did not come to pass:

1) The Conservative party is self-serving and cruel, but they're not insane

2) Brexit is by nature a political poisoned chalice because of the strong opinions on both sides; Europe has always been a divisive issue and the government must understand this.

3) Because of 2, a bipartisan commission or committee would be established to negotiate Brexit. This would allow the Tories to have their cake and eat it. Setbacks could be blamed on Labour/EU and their own involvement downplayed whilst successes and positive outcomes could be bigged-up since it was still their sitting government ""delivering the will of the electorate"".

4) Even if the Tories did decide to go it alone in the negotiations, they wouldn't be *utterly* incompetent, surely.

5) An election is probably right around the corner because of this mess; maybe we can get a Labour government, or a Labour-led coalition who I believe would negotiate somewhat more competently than a Conservative one.

6) The Leave vote probably won't win anyway, because it seems like everyone is in favour of the EU, or at least willing to look past its flaws.

7) There will be a deal. We will negotiate a deal; it might not please everyone and it might take quite a lot of negotiating, but the PM isn't going to try to ram one particular version of it down Parliament's throats three or four times with little to no amendment or negotiation because that would be stupid.

Whilst I stand by my criticisms of the EU, if there had been a second referendum I would have voted Remain.","If I voted Brexit, I did so because I believe that leaving the European Union will bring greater economic and political autonomy to the United Kingdom. I am confident that leaving the EU will free the UK to pursue its own economic and trade policies, and will give the nation greater control over its own borders and immigration policies. I believe that this will lead to a stronger economy and a better quality of life for all British citizens. On a personal level, I am confident that I will benefit from greater job and career opportunities, as well as improved public services and infrastructure."

Edit 2: don’t reply to me with man hating bullshit please. Nice Guys are an actual problem, but for every Nice Guy I’ve met, I’ve met a dozen regular guys just trying to live their lives. I’ve dated some really awesome dudes who it just didn’t work out with and I’m still with an awesome guy who’s been my rock through some really shitty times. I know just as many pos women as I know pos men.","It really depends on the situation. If the ""nice guy"" was genuinely trying to express his feelings in a respectful way and it just came out wrong, then it's possible to give him a chance. If it was more of an outburst of anger and disrespect, then it's probably best not to give him a chance. In my experience, it's rarely worked out when someone has thrown a tantrum."

831,What was the worst job interview you've had?,"I had an interview where I knew the answers I gave were good, solid examples. I understood the technical side well. But the interviewer kept sneering, being rude and saying “really?” In a skeptical tone and I got the distinct impression he hated me. About 20 mins in, I thought about politely calling it a day and leaving but in my innocence thought it would be good practice to stay. 40 mins in, it’s like a light switch goes off inside and he’s the nicest guy, his eyes light up and he started hard selling the role and position to me. Introduces me to the team. The director interviews me and he and the team are lovely. Apparently, their interview technique is to be rude to see how you perform under pressure and they’d all been observing using a camera and were impressed I remained so polite and calm throughout. They couldn’t understand why I declined.

EDIT: to save me responding to comments. I understand pressure testing is a legitimate technique, and whilst I felt deeply uncomfortable and my gut was screaming at me to get out of there like in a nightclub when you know the creepy guy is really bad news and you need to get out, I understood that it was a possibility that that is what he could have been doing.

However to add more context, they had my work history including 10 years in the ambulance services which involves resuscitation whilst the public yell at you and threaten you. I’m used to being polite and professional whilst being harassed and threatened. 

Nothing spreadsheet based, even pulling all nighters is going to match that for pressure and I’m well known for staying calm and composed all the time (even if I’m exploding inside).

My biggest objection was not realising I was being broadcast and hearing them discuss my reactions to my face, like I was some kind of movie actor.

That was not my intention, and I will make sure to be clearer next time.",I had a patient come in with a very swollen and sore left arm. He had already been to two other doctors who had both diagnosed him with an infection and had prescribed antibiotics. He was not improving and was still in immense pain.

863,"[Serious] ""The ascent of billionaires is a symptom & outcome of an immoral system that tells people affordable insulin is impossible but exploitation is fine"" - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What are your thoughts on this?","As a type 1 diabetic this is very close to my own personal experience. I was diagnosed when I was a baby; just 1.5 years old. So I've lived with the condition for my entire lifetime, essentially.   


Many people are unaware of what type 1 diabetes actually is, so I'll give a basic rundown just FYI. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system targets and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin (beta cells in the islets of langerhans). Insulin is a critical hormone that allows the body to metabolize glucose for energy. An untreated type 1 diabetic will die within a couple of days, without insulin.   


Contemporary insulins (humalog, novolog, and lantus, etc) have been around for decades with only minor tweaks to the production of those insulins. The price for a 10ml vial of humalog or novolog was around $20, over the counter, without insurance. Those same insulins are now priced at \~ $300 over the counter, without insurance. That's an astronomical price increase without any major change to the formula or production method used.   


I may be off the mark here in just talking about the price of insulin and not talking about billionaires, but you don't need billionaires to understand just how ethically bankrupt our systems are when a product like insulin which is necessary for survival is priced at a point of such staggering profit. It costs something like $6 to produce a 10mL vial of life sustaining insulin, which is then priced at \~ $300. People die because they can't afford to pay that. It's just wrong.","I completely agree with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The billionaire class has grown exponentially over the past few decades, and this has been enabled by a system that allows some to exploit and benefit from the suffering of others. It is unacceptable that people are unable to access affordable insulin, yet the wealthy few are able to accumulate more wealth than ever before. We need to create a society where everyone has access to the resources they need, not one where a few can benefit at the expense of the many."
864,"(Serious) Redditors who witnessed a murder, what is your story?","Saw my friend get shot in the head and died a few mins later during a cross fire between her oldest brother and the police. Was very heartbreaking. I still miss her 22 years later. 

We were playing on a field next to her house and her brother was watching us, he pulled a gun out, started shooting as soon as he saw the police.

I didnt think this would get alot of attention. Thank you for all the awards and all the happy cake days, for the ones who post it on here, for some reason i can not see them on the post. But thank you. 

Sorry if i have not reply to everyone.","I'm not sure if I witnessed a murder, but I did witness a shooting. It happened about 10 years ago when I was visiting a city in the Midwest. I was walking down a street late at night when I heard a loud bang. I heard a man scream and then I saw him fall to the ground. I quickly ran away and called the police. They arrived quickly and I gave them a description of the suspect and the direction he ran. The police were able to apprehend the suspect and the victim later died in the hospital due to his injuries. It was a very traumatic experience and one that I will never forget."

One of the employees was a single mother who had a young daughter. She had to work on the weekend, but her daughter was sick and needed to be picked up from school early. The employee asked her boss if she could leave early to pick up her daughter, but the boss refused because it violated the rule. 

The employee then called her daughter's school and told them she was sending someone to pick her up, and that the person was authorized to pick her up. She then called another employee who was off that day and asked them to pick her daughter up from school. When the other employee arrived, the principal was confused because the daughter wasn't registered in their system. The employee explained the situation and the principal felt so bad for the single mother that she gave the daughter a full scholarship for the remainder of the year, tuition free. 

The boss was so embarrassed by the situation that he changed the rule and allowed employees to leave early if they had a family emergency."
870,All You can eat buffet workers what are your horror stories?,"Not a ""Horror"" story, just funny.

I worked at Wendy's when they had salad bars. You could get a single-serving bowl (They used to serve eat-in chili in Styrofoam bowls, and the Large doubled as a chili bowl), or ""All you can eat"" platters. (The Taco Salad bottom plate.)

On a slow afternoon, this guy came in and got a single serving bowl. After a few minutes, our manager motioned to me and the sandwich guy to discreetly take a look at the salad he was making.

The guy had filled the bowl with salad, then made a ring of overlapping cucumber slices to extend the lip of the bowl upwards. He filled that with salad, then added another ring. It took several minutes to build this thing, but by the time he'd finished, he had a tower of salad well over a foot tall, wth multiple rings of cucumber slices containing it. 

That salad was an engineering marvel. He carefully carried it back to his table, sat down, then looked up guiltily as our manager walked out to him.

The manager handed him a ""free item"" coupon, and said, ""That is the most impressive salad I have ever seen. Your next one is on me.""","1. The person who comes in and takes one bite of everything on the buffet before leaving.
