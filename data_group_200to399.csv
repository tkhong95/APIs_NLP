0,How does an autistic male in his mid-20s go about talking to women,"What hobbies or interests do you have? Because statistically at least some women would share the same as you. Try to find common ground, and be honest and accept that you will experience mis communication and try to have a light sense of humour in the fuck ups. 
Im an autistic lesbian (23)  in a relationship with another autistic lesbian and so far, I probably wouldn't be interested in dating an allistic person but its not an impossible option :) hope that was at least a little bit helpful

Edited to add my age.","?

The best way for an autistic male in his mid-20s to go about talking to women is to start with small talk and build up to deeper conversations from there. Start with simple questions about her day, interests, hobbies, etc. to get the conversation going. Ask open-ended questions to encourage a more meaningful dialogue, and be sure to actively listen to her responses. It may also help to participate in activities or join social groups where it’s easier to meet and talk to women. Additionally, practice talking to women in a non-threatening environment (e.g. with friends or family) to build confidence and better prepare for conversations with women."
1,"If we haven't seen/heard of a time traveler, would that mean there has not been found a way in the future for time traveling?",That would be a logical conclusion.,"No, it does not necessarily mean that time travel is impossible. It could mean that time travelers have been able to travel to the past but have chosen not to interact with the present for whatever reason. Alternatively, it could mean that time travel is possible but has not yet been discovered or utilized by humans."
2,Why didnt Stalin attack Hitler first before operation barbarossa?,"He was in no position to even consider such a move.  He had recently gutted the officer corps in a huge purge, and needed years to get to the point where an offensive war would be a realistic option.  His priority at that point was destroying all internal dissent, and not launching a war with the most powerful army in Europe.  He felt that continuing to send a lot of raw materials and in other ways continuing to cooperate with Germany would buy him the time he needed to decide that matter later on, when the USSR was ready and able to consider such moves. It's also worth bearing in mind that he had very recently watched the Red Army get its ass handed to it by tiny Finland.

As it happens, by all accounts he really thought that he had those years, and that Hitler wouldn't attack while still at war on another front.  Obviously he was very wrong about that, and some accounts suggest he had some sort of mental breakdown when it happened.","Stalin had a non-aggression pact with Hitler, so he was not expecting an attack from Germany. Stalin was actually hoping to gain more territory through negotiations with Hitler and thought that he could put off a potential war with Germany until a later date. Stalin's focus was on modernizing and strengthening the Soviet Union, so he did not feel ready to launch an attack on Germany."
3,Why are MLMs not illegal?,"Because you can package and repackage them in ways that don’t make the MLM part very obvious. 

I remember watching a video about an MLM that changed to 7 or 8 different companies just by slightly tweaking a few things to make sure people didn’t know what they really were.","MLMs are not illegal because they are legitimate businesses. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates MLMs and requires that they adhere to certain rules and regulations. These rules and regulations are in place to protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices. The FTC also requires MLMs to provide full disclosure to potential participants about the business opportunity, the risks and rewards of investing in the company, and the compensation structure. Furthermore, MLMs must comply with state and federal laws, including anti-pyramid laws."

5,Why do old family pictures in movies look so fake?,"Because its not the actual actor as a child, but a random child actor","Old family pictures in movies often look fake because they are usually digitally created or composited from multiple images.

It is perfectly normal to have a wide range of interests and to be constantly learning and exploring new things."
14,Why do I feel guilty for wanting/receiving things?,Do you have low self esteem? I feel similar way because I feel like I don't deserve gifts or attention.,"Feeling guilty for wanting or receiving things is a common experience, and it can stem from a few different sources. One possibility is that you have internalized a belief system that emphasizes modesty and humility, so wanting or receiving things goes against your values. Another possibility is that you have difficulty accepting and enjoying success or positive things without feeling undeserving or guilty. It could also be that you feel guilty because you have been conditioned to believe that you shouldn't be taking anything away from someone else. If this is something that is causing distress, it might be helpful to explore these feelings further with a mental health professional."

27,Why do some Americans seem to think that people only want to immigrate to America and not other countries?,I would argue that's a false accusation. We're just focused on our own issues first because it's such a major problem and political bait for us. But we are very aware of what's happening in Germany and Spain and Greece and even UK.,"Some Americans may think this because of the long history of immigration to the United States.

31,Why do hurricanes push up hot humid air from the tropics but when they make landfall it's cooler?,"Tropical Storms is nature's air conditioning. They move heat from hot places to cooler places. As the storm moves north, the water and air temperature are lower, so the storm dissipates heat. By the time they get to land in Canada, they have dumped their heat into the water and air, thus are cooler. 

As water vapor gets cooler it condenses into water droplets that become rain. This lowers the humidity. Since the water temperatures are cooler more north, there is less evaporation from the ocean to replenish the storm keeping humidity down, plus the evaporate moisture it picks up is cooler and allows the storm to fade out.","When a hurricane moves over warm, tropical waters, it absorbs the heat and moisture from the water and pushes it up into the atmosphere. This creates high pressure in the atmosphere, which causes the hot, humid air to move into the atmosphere. When this hot, humid air reaches cooler temperatures near land, the air cools and the pressure drops, resulting in cooler temperatures."

It implies that the woman has a strong, powerful presence over the man, and that he is unable to resist her."
34,Why are people becoming less and less considerate of others?,An individualistic society and lack of reprecussions breeds that type of behavior,"There are a number of potential reasons why people might be becoming less considerate of others. The first is that our society is increasingly becoming more individualistic, with people placing a greater emphasis on their own needs and desires than on the needs and desires of others. Additionally, technology has enabled people to become more isolated from one another, reducing the need for them to interact in person and thus diminishing the need to be considerate.

Anyone who paid in full gets the full amount (15.5 times 6 = 90.90) and the seventh person gets 15.5 times 0.6 = 9.09

However since that would result in 99.99, we should add the remaining penny to the last person’s share resulting in 9.10.",The six people who paid 100$ each should each receive an additional 10$ for their contribution to the final sum of 660$. The last person who paid 60$ should receive an additional 40$. This would make the total amount given to each person 110$ (100$ + 10$ or 60$ + 40$).

51,"Why are violent people who ""spare women"" still concidered honourable in this day and age?","Well, you described 2 different scenarios:

A warship is bound to be full of combatants and people who are trying to kill you or otherwise defend themselves by killing you before you kill them. So it'd depend on if anyone surrendered, IMO. You could really add ""elderly"" onto that women and children thing, probably.

A criminal, on the other hand, requires more context. Serial killers who target men aren't more sane or honourable than the ones who kill anyone else. Theyre all still equally psychopaths for killing people. At least to me. Maybe the context of the former bleeds into the latter. Combatants generally being men, who can defend themselves, against women who can't really do it as well and weren't amongst combatants but with the children and the elderly.

So, yes, a little; but it depends. I think the reality of us being physically different affects the perception of ""combatant,"" but considering innocent people combatants based on sex is presumptuous: so it can be kind of sexist.","The idea of being “honourable” is a subjective concept. Some people may view a violent person who “spares women” as honourable because they view it as a sign of respect, and may feel that it demonstrates a sense of chivalry. On the other hand, some people may consider such an action to be inappropriate and not honourable in any way. Ultimately, it is up to individual interpretation and opinion."
52,"i was totally lied to, right?","Well, you described 2 different scenarios:

A warship is bound to be full of combatants and people who are trying to kill you or otherwise defend themselves by killing you before you kill them. So it'd depend on if anyone surrendered, IMO. You could really add ""elderly"" onto that women and children thing, probably.

A criminal, on the other hand, requires more context. Serial killers who target men aren't more sane or honourable than the ones who kill anyone else. Theyre all still equally psychopaths for killing people. At least to me. Maybe the context of the former bleeds into the latter. Combatants generally being men, who can defend themselves, against women who can't really do it as well and weren't amongst combatants but with the children and the elderly.

So, yes, a little; but it depends. I think the reality of us being physically different affects the perception of ""combatant,"" but considering innocent people combatants based on sex is presumptuous: so it can be kind of sexist.",It is impossible to answer this question without more information.
53,Why don’t you feel the automatic gearbox change gears?,"I haven't driven with automatic gearboxes very much but when I did I could definitely feel the gearbox change gears. It was noticeable not only from the sound but also from the ""pull"" of the car. So I can't say I relate to the premise of your question.","The automatic gearbox is designed to shift gears seamlessly and without any noticeable change. This is done by using a torque converter to manage the transmission of power from the engine to the wheels. As the engine speed increases, the transmission shifts to the next gear ratio in order to maintain the desired speed. This shift is usually accompanied by a slight decrease in engine RPM, but the change is usually so subtle that it is not noticeable to the driver."
54,"If one male can impregnate many females, why is there 50% males and 50% females","If the ratio goes one way, it becomes more advantageous to have a child of the opposite gender. Evolution ensures we then slide back towards 50/50.","in the population?

The 50/50 ratio of males to females in the population is due to the fact that each individual has an equal chance of being male or female at the time of conception. This is determined by a combination of the sperm and egg cells from the parents. Even though one male can impregnate many females, the ratio of males and females in the population remains the same since the same number of males and females are being born."
55,How do I tell my boss she can't bring up my disability as a way to talk down to me?,"Sorry to hear about your experience

It's important to address this issue professionally, emphasizing your capability to handle responsibilities despite your disability.",It is important to be assertive and direct when communicating with your boss. You can tell your boss that you do not appreciate her bringing up your disability as a way to talk down to you and that you would like her to refrain from doing so. Be sure to explain why this behavior is unacceptable and how it makes you feel. You may also want to suggest alternative ways for your boss to communicate with you in a respectful manner.
56,Is it morally wrong to date your friend's grandma if she initiated the relationship?,"I don't know about ""morally wrong"", but it might be a sensitive thing for your friend. So if you go along with the relationship your friend may very well be upset and it could damage your friendship. As a general rule, if you want to date any close family member of a friend it might be a good idea to speak to your friend about it first, not necessarily to get their ""permission"" but just to show that you care about and respect their feelings so you don't want to just jump into it behind their back.

But then there's the thing about it being your friend's *grandma*, which implies there might a pretty big age difference here? Unless you're significantly older than your friend? *That* might be a bit iffy in itself, but it depends on the circumstances.","In general, it is not morally wrong to date someone if both parties are consenting and happy in the relationship. However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of the relationship for your friend and their family. If your friend and their family are not comfortable with the relationship, it is best to respect their wishes and not pursue the relationship."
57,"People that don't have close friends and families, and are not in a relationship, how are you doing?",Probably not good,"I'm doing okay. It can be difficult to feel lonely and isolated at times, but I'm learning to find joy and fulfillment in activities and hobbies that bring me joy. I'm also doing my best to stay connected with friends and family, even if it's just through virtual means."
58,From where did the craze of Becoming rich comes from all of a sudden?,It is not sudden. People have been wanting to get rich for centuries.,"The idea of becoming rich has been around for centuries, but the craze of becoming rich quickly is a relatively modern phenomenon. It can be attributed to the rise of consumerism, the proliferation of media, and the emergence of get-rich-quick schemes. The idea of making a large amount of money quickly has become an increasingly attractive prospect for many people, especially as the cost of living continues to rise and wages remain stagnant."
59,"Is subtly showing off salary in early stages of dating, a red flag?",It does sound like he is boasting about his salary etc but it could be a nervous thing . Only way to tell is have another date and challenge him I’d he brings it up again in a calm and measured way .,"Yes, it can be a red flag. Showing off salary in an early stage of dating can be a sign of insecurity or a need to impress. It can also be a sign of someone who is trying to gain control in the relationship. It is best to get to know someone on a deeper level before discussing financial information."
60,Why are bicycles more popular than tricycles (or quadracycles)?,"While they might be harder to learn how to use, bicycles are more practical once you learn to ride them. They take up less space, are easier to turn sharply, have fewer moving parts and tires that might break and need replacing, and frankly they aren't hard to balance at all once you learn how. I'd imagine that's why they're more popular.","Bicycles are more popular than tricycles or quadracycles because they are more efficient and easier to ride. Bicycles require less effort to move forward and have fewer parts and components, making them simpler to maintain and repair. Furthermore, they require less space to store and are more portable."
61,How can I relate to a black family in Compton as a white recently former Nebraskan?,"Openness. Tell them what you’re feeling and what your experiences are, and let them know that you are (and be!!) open to receiving the same from them. Ask THEM what movies/books/podcasts would benefit you to understand their family, their history, and their experiences. Ask them to help you navigate if you’re feeling unsure.","The best way to relate to a black family in Compton as a white recently former Nebraskan is to focus on common ground. Despite the differences in your backgrounds, you both likely share values, experiences, and perspectives. Try to think about the things that you all have in common, such as shared interests, values, and experiences. You could talk about the things you miss about Nebraska, or the things you are looking forward to in California, and how both places have shaped who you are. Ask questions about their experiences in Compton and try to understand their perspectives. Most importantly, be open and respectful, and demonstrate that you are interested in learning about their culture and experiences."
62,Is 20 too old to have posters and prints all around your room?,"Here's the secret; if you want your space to look more ""adult,"" put your posters in frames. Boom, now they're art prints and you're classy.","No, 20 is not too old to have posters and prints all around your room. It is a matter of personal preference and can depend on the posters and prints that you choose."
63,How much does the average person cry?,Days a week ? My last time was 8 years ago because of a breakup.,"There is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on the individual. Some people may cry rarely, while others may cry frequently."
64,How can you best approach the situation and would this be a pet peeve or just whatever?,You're basically the best person ever.,"The best way to approach this situation is to be understanding and respectful. Listen to the person's concerns and try to come to a solution that works for both of you. Depending on the severity of the issue, this could be a pet peeve or just something that needs to be addressed and worked out."
65,Can an adult survive in an artificial womb?,Sure.  It will just be difficult.,"No, an adult cannot survive in an artificial womb. Artificial wombs are designed to nurture and develop a fetus until it is ready to be born. They are not designed to sustain an adult."
66,Is it legal if while driving I come to a complete stop well before the stop sign?,"You need to pull up and stop at the stop sign or stop line. If you are stopped significantly before the stop sign and then just go, you are running the stop sign and breaking the law.

What you are describing is explicitly illegal.","Yes, it is legal to come to a complete stop before a stop sign. It is often recommended to do so to ensure that drivers have enough time to check for other cars and pedestrians before proceeding."
67,Why doesn't anyone just reproduce old vehicles that are so rare today?,"I'm not sure but I can imagine that there are those who make replicas of old vehicles. However usually what makes these vehicles desirable is that they are originals from back when they were originally manufactured, like collector's items. So owning a perfect replica that was manufactured recently wouldn't be as cool as owning an actual original from decades ago. At least I assume that's part of it.","There are a few reasons why this isn't done. Firstly, the original parts and tools required to replicate a vehicle are often no longer available, making it difficult to make an exact replica. Secondly, the cost of reproducing an old vehicle can be very expensive, particularly if the vehicle is considered to be a classic or vintage model. Lastly, it can be difficult to find enough buyers for the reproduction vehicles, as the market for vintage cars is limited."
68,Is it Islamaphobic to think that having 4 wives is beyond ridiculous?,"Mormons have multiple wives, people who just practice general polyamory have multiple partners. 

So no, not Islamaphobic when so many other groups of people do it.","Yes, it is Islamaphobic to think that having four wives is beyond ridiculous. While some people may find the idea of having more than one wife to be strange, it is a part of Islamic culture and should not be judged or ridiculed."
69,Are time zones dictated by the length of the day or by the size of the planet?,"Time zones are for people, not an innate feature of a planet. There's no way to compress your awake-asleep cycle into 10 hours or stretch it to 248 days, so I don't think there would ever be time zones on either planet since it would be easier to just have one time like UTC and let the sun do whatever.","Time zones are typically dictated by the length of the day, although the size of the planet can also be a factor. For example, the International Date Line passes through the Pacific Ocean, and is based on the size of the planet."
70,What counts as a mirror for cleaning products?,If it’s a mirror.,"Any type of glass surface can be used as a mirror for cleaning products. This includes windows, mirrors, stainless steel, and other non-porous surfaces."
71,Is it weird to eat PB&J sandwiches for lunch as a grown man with a job?,Only thing that's weird is a grown man giving a shit what anyone else thinks about what he eats for lunch.,"No, it is not weird to eat PB&J sandwiches for lunch as a grown man with a job. Many people enjoy PB&J sandwiches for lunch and it is a perfectly acceptable meal."
72,Do blind people have preferred body types?,Stevie did😂,"No, blind people do not have preferred body types. Everyone has different preferences when it comes to physical attractiveness and body types, and this is no different for people with a visual impairment."
73,How do I open my throat to chug?,Probably the same technique you’d use to swallow a sword or deep throat a cock? I’m sure there’s videos on YouTube.,The best way to open your throat to chug a drink is to tilt your head back and take a deep breath. This will help relax your throat muscles and make it easier to swallow the liquid. You can also practice taking small sips of water before trying to chug a larger beverage.
74,"WTF do you do when you're a guest in someone's house, you poop in their toilet and after you flush, there's poop streaks in the toilet bowl?","Usually, there's a toilet brush hidden near the toilet, so you clean them.","It is important to be respectful of other people's homes when you are a guest. If you see streaks of poop in the toilet bowl, you should take a few minutes to clean it up. Depending on the type of toilet, you may need to use a toilet brush, a cleaning product, or a combination of both to remove the streaks. If you do not have the necessary supplies, it is best to let the homeowner know about the issue so they can address it."
75,"Why do people say ""retail/hospitality workers deserve a break"" when someone expresses a wish stores were open longer?","I do believe you've lucked out on the place you worked at. I've done shift work in 2 different fields and to me it was brutal. Night shifts especially fucked me up. Working holidays/weekends/nights when everyone else is off doing what they want doesn't get compensated nearly enough financially. 

I'm now no longer working night shifts or weekends and it's been a blessing. I would never go back unless I'm on the verge of homelessness.","People say ""retail/hospitality workers deserve a break"" when someone expresses a wish stores were open longer because they recognize that these workers often work long and demanding hours in order to provide services to customers. They understand that these workers have very little time to rest and recover, and that extended hours would only exacerbate this problem. As such, they believe that these workers should be given a break and not be expected to work longer hours than necessary."
76,Are zodiac signs even real?,"In what way? Yes they are real, do they impact you or your personality in any way? No","No, zodiac signs are not real in the sense that the stars and planets do not actually influence people's personalities or destinies. They are merely a system of beliefs created by ancient cultures and used in astrology."
77,Why is there always a Chinese restaurant in even the smallest of small towns in America?,The majority of people like Chinese food and cooking several dishes at home would take a lot of time so it probably would do a good business even in a small town.,"Chinese restaurants are popular in small towns across the U.S. because they often offer a variety of affordable, familiar dishes. Chinese restaurants are often cheaper than other restaurants, making them attractive to small-town diners. Additionally, many Chinese dishes have become familiar to Americans, making them comfortable and familiar choices for diners in small towns."
78,What do woman like more?,"Neither, both.

Women aren't a collective hive mind that swings one way or another for different types of men. Some women don't even like men.

I think you and your friends should go and talk to individual women and then see what happens.","There is no single answer to this question as all women are different and have different likes and dislikes. Some women may like certain things more than others, and some may not like certain things at all."
79,Non verbal but I'm not autistic,That's a question for your doctor or therapist.,"Non-verbal communication is the use of body language, facial expressions, and gestures to communicate. People who are not autistic can still use non-verbal communication to communicate and express their thoughts and feelings."
80,Does “validating your partner’s feelings” apply if they’re saying things that are hurtful and false?,"Not trying to say you have ADHD or anything, but I do and recognise myself in this. The dynamics you’re discussing (partner feeling like they mother the other, being resentful for it, defensiveness etc) are explained really well in this book called “The ADHD effect on marriage” by Melissa Orlov - I would really recommend it, whether you suspect/do have ADHD or not, because these exact patterns are illustrated and the methods to find solitons can absolutely still be applicable.

When hoping to solve an emotional issue, it’s counter-productive to try to be “objective” and put things into perspective, especially if it comes across as a defensive response (which you admitted it was). It’s about recognising the _isolated_ impact of the specific issue the partner is bringing up and working to understand _that specific issue only_. I really recommend the book and look into other material on the parent-child dynamic in relationships. While in the whole context, this may feel like an exaggerated description, there are clearly times where this is what’s going on, whether you mean for it or not. The gender aspect is not to be ignore either, as it’s especially common for men to end up on the “child” end of the equation, which is hard on both of you. She may also be getting some exposure to the concept of “weaponised incompetence” which really doesn’t seem to be what you’re doing here, on purpose, not at all, BUT I can tell you that when my own wife was in your wife’s position, her distress did bring her to wonder whether I was perhaps being careless on purpose or careless by being thoughtless and inconsiderate, because I’d just expect her to pick up the slack. They don’t say that because they don’t love us or truly believe it, but it’s a natural thing for them to at least wonder about.

There’s a way out of this cycle, man, if you put the effort in to take apart the real elements leading to the issue, and materials meant for people with ADHD and their spouses could really help you here, in my experience.

I’m a big believer in reading up on systems used by people to solve problems, whether  I share a diagnosis with them or not :)

Edit: Realised this may not have been clear, but your wife may totally be aware of the help you give her with the driving (for which she may have her own unexpressed insecurities as you do? so maybe it was an extra pain point regardless), the packing up etc. She knows you’re competent and consistent in that respect, but she seems to have difficulty dealing with what to her are your “unexplained” struggles with completing other assorted tasks, like the hamster one. It can be an anxious thing onto itself, to wonder whether your partner can handle anything else but the standard tasks you know they can. I say this because if this interpretation is correct, I’m your counterpart and I find it very hard to competently complete “new” tasks with full awareness of what’s going on sometimes, especially if I need to measure up against my partner who’s co-doing the task with me. I’m slower and our approaches are different and this distresses her - she’s faster snd therefore ends up waiting on me and ultimately giving me “instructions” to do simple and quick (to her) things when I haven’t yet moved on to the next step when she’d expect me to have.

Bottom line is - when someone is particularly frustrated or anxious about their partner’s ability or willingness to help in a relationship in the way they hope for, it’s easy for them to be a little bit unfair in how they portray the total share of work. This is not because she can’t see the objectivity of the task sharing and mutual support, but it’s  because the things she worries about have more relative weight to her. Focusing on this has been key to my own improvement in my marriage.

Second edit: Mate, at the risk of sounding nosy, I looked at your profile a bit more and you should look into an ADHD diagnosis. Just some advice from someone who thinks she can recognise it - worst that can happen is you rule it out :)","No, validating your partner's feelings does not apply if they are saying things that are hurtful and false. Instead, it is important to calmly and respectfully explain to your partner why their words are hurtful and untrue. It is also important to recognize that your partner may be feeling a certain way and that it is valid for them to feel that way, even if their words are hurtful."
81,Is it true that the A/C doesn’t use gas?,"A/C runs on electricity, but your car makes electricity with the alternator, and that uses the engine to run.  Especially in a little four-cylinder car you can hear the engine and see the RPMs rev up just a bit when you turn on the A/C.  Yes: ultimately it uses a little more gas to use the A/C.

Your car should be able to idle with the A/C on.  And really… you shouldn’t be getting so low on gas that this matters.  Don’t let yourself get that low.  It’s not like a drastic difference.  But there’s no such thing as free energy, and the only energy you add to the car is gas, so ultimately it all runs on gas.","No, air conditioners do use gas. Most air conditioners use a refrigerant gas, such as Freon, to cool the air."
82,How do you handshake?,"Sometimes I suppose I'd say it depends on the person

I do a little dainty light handshake because I don't give a Fuck and have never had to prove shit with my handshake, it's not my problem if others have an issue with it","A handshake is a gesture of greeting in which two people grasp each other's right hands and move their hands up and down. The gesture is a symbol of friendship, collegiality, respect, and goodwill."
83,Are Nicotine patches safe for general use?,Do not start. At all. Whatsoever.,"Yes, nicotine patches are generally considered safe for use. However, like any other medication, it is important to speak with your doctor before using a nicotine patch to ensure it is the right option for you."
84,Why doesn't the world go to universal power plug socket?,"As with many things, an [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/927/) explains it best.

As a more practical matter: you said in the opening ""the infrastructure costs are huge"". 

So why not choose the best one?

Well, what if someone invents an even better one next year? Do it all over again?","There are several reasons why the world has not adopted a universal power plug socket. One of the main reasons is cost. It would be very expensive to redesign and replace all of the existing power outlets and plugs in the world. Additionally, different countries have different voltage and frequency standards, which would need to be addressed in the design of any universal power plug socket. There are also significant safety concerns that would need to be addressed before any universal power plug socket could be adopted. Finally, there is the issue of political will. Governments and corporations would need to cooperate to make a universal power plug socket a reality."
85,Why health boards allow sashimi and raw foods to be sold?,Because the raw stuff like sashimi are flash frozen and are pretty safe.,"Health boards allow sashimi and other raw foods to be sold because they are safe to consume when prepared properly and with the right techniques. Sashimi is made from the freshest fish and is typically flash frozen to kill any unwanted bacteria or parasites. The fish is then cut into thin slices, and served raw. This process ensures that any potential contaminants are killed and that the fish is safe to eat. Additionally, health boards ensure that the fish is from a reputable source and that the vendor is following all the necessary safety protocols."
86,What is our purpose here?,"> there has to be another deeper meaning

Nah. Why? Make your own purpose, dont worry about what you're 'supposed' to be here for.",Our purpose here is to work together to achieve our shared goals and to create a positive and productive environment.
87,Do cats have armpits or legpits?,Goddamn I love your name.,"Cats do not have either armpits or legpits. Cats have sweat glands in their paws and around their face, which help them regulate their body temperature."
88,Any thoughts on drake's new song Slime you Out?,"He may be light skinned, but he dimwitted","Drake's new song ""Slime You Out"" is a nice blend of hip-hop and R&B, with a catchy beat and some clever lyrics. It's definitely a song that will get stuck in your head. The production is top-notch and Drake's flow is smooth. It's definitely a song that Drake fans will enjoy."
89,How much hair do you actually lose everyday?,"Hi /u/KPoppa1020,

90,Why are there so many handsome comedians now?,its the ultimate joke,"It could be argued that the rise of social media has allowed comedians to gain more attention and recognition for their work, which has helped to make comedy more accessible and popular. As a result, more people are becoming interested in the comedy world and talented comedians are being discovered and given more opportunities to showcase their skills. This has led to an increase in the number of handsome comedians, as they can now reach a larger audience and gain more exposure than ever before."
91,Age Difference,"Yes.

Edit: Actually, South Korea switched to the international system this year, so it's not entirely true, legally, that you start at age 1 in South Korea.","The age difference between two people depends on the age of each person. Generally, a larger age difference is considered more significant if the ages of the two people are further apart."
92,Why is it so difficult to trace the descendants of American Plantation owners?,Probably so people don't harass them.,"Tracing the descendants of American Plantation owners is difficult because many of the records from that period have been lost or destroyed over time. Additionally, the records that do exist can be difficult to access due to their age and location. Many of the records from this period are not digitized, making them difficult to search and access. Furthermore, many of the plantation owners had large families, making it difficult to trace the exact lineage of a particular ancestor. Finally, the social and economic conditions of the time made it difficult for plantation owners to keep accurate records of their descendants."
93,Did Boomers Ruin America?,No.,"No, Boomers did not ruin America. While Boomers have had a significant impact on the country, it is unfair to say that they ruined it. It is important to note that there are many factors that have contributed to the current state of the nation, and Boomers are just one of them."
94,What is that weird cat Smurf I keep seeing everywhere?,It’s apparently [a TikTok thing](https://lifehacker.com/what-is-smurf-cat-1850842927),The Smurf cat is a popular meme that originated from a Japanese manga comic series. The character is a large white cat with a blue hat and blue overalls. The cat is often used to represent the feeling of being overwhelmed or confused in a situation.
95,"What is a good response to an employee saying “did you forget to tip?” when a tip is NOT warranted in a non-service situation (ie coffee, to-go, etc)?","I've just never been asked that. I would just say ""no"", I guess","It's not customary to tip in this situation, thank you for understanding."
96,Why does my cat chew/lick cardboard and then stares at me for a minute then runs away?,He's sharpening his fangs. The stare is seething hatred and a strong desire to kill you. It runs away because it's not quite time to rid the world of your presence.,Cats may chew and lick cardboard because it has a pleasant texture and taste. It may also be a way to soothe their mouths if they are teething or have an itch. Cats may also stare at you after chewing on cardboard because they are seeking attention or wanting you to join in the fun. It's possible they run away afterwards because they are feeling playful and want to initiate a game of chase.

98,"If my eyes are bad already, would there be a point in taking something for eye health?",Eat carrot,"Yes, there is still a point in taking something for eye health, even if your eyes are already bad. Certain vitamins, minerals, and supplements can help to maintain eye health, reduce the risk of further vision problems, and even improve existing vision. However, it is important to speak with your doctor and optometrist to determine which specific supplements are right for you."
99,How do non-western people perceive cultural appropriation?,"In my country (Indonesia), we're usually thrilled when a foreigner wants to respectfully wear and use our cultural items","Non-Western people often view cultural appropriation as a form of exploitation and disrespect. It can be seen as an act of cultural theft, in which people from dominant cultures take elements from non-dominant cultures for their own purposes without permission or understanding of the original context and cultural significance. This can be seen as a form of colonialism and imperialism, which has been a source of great pain and suffering for many non-Western people."
100,Did every peasant in England know about Henry VIII during his reign?,"Important events would be announced in church, so yes everyone would know who was King","No, not every peasant in England would have known about Henry VIII during his reign. Most peasants were illiterate and did not have access to news or information about the monarchy."
101,Were most Americans actually really eager to enlist in the army during WW2?,"Pfffft. No. Lol. That's propaganda.

Did some people volunteer? Yeah of course. Maybe there were even some stories like what you said at like the very start of the war.

But the vast *vast* majority of people recruited were conscripts. They were drafted.","No, not all Americans were eager to enlist in the army during World War II. While many Americans were willing to serve and support the war effort, many others were reluctant to enlist, either out of fear of war or out of a desire to remain at home and continue their civilian lives."
102,Does reddit have a way to suggest subs you've never been to based on your comments?,"Pfffft. No. Lol. That's propaganda.

Did some people volunteer? Yeah of course. Maybe there were even some stories like what you said at like the very start of the war.

But the vast *vast* majority of people recruited were conscripts. They were drafted.","No, Reddit does not have a feature to suggest subs based on your comments.

103,Where are all the Blonde Men?,How many of those blonde women are naturally that blonde? I don't know that many,"Blonde men can be found in many places, including the United States, Europe, and other parts of the world. They can be found in various occupations, ranging from business to entertainment. Blonde men can also be found in online communities and social media groups dedicated to the topic."
104,Does anyone else look at pictures of themselves and feel a disconnect from what they see?,That sounds like depersonalization or maybe derealization. I have cptsd and when I dissociate I have a hard time recognizing myself in the mirror. Like I’m looking into these eyes that aren’t mine. Same with pictures of myself. Maybe someone else can chime in with more experience.,"Yes, absolutely. It can be difficult to look at pictures of ourselves and feel like we are seeing an accurate reflection of who we are. It can be hard to recognize ourselves or even feel a sense of disconnection from the person in the photo. We all have different perspectives on ourselves and our self-image, and it can be hard to reconcile what we see in pictures with our internal sense of self."
105,Faucet water was running brown and I drank it?,"I suppose you'll know tomorrow, I'd invest in a water filter inform your landlord that your water is brown.

The pros outweigh the cons for me, but yeah occasionally shit creeps into legitimate subs.

I think the mods here do a good job at getting rid of insincere contributions","There doesn't seem to be a surge of trolls in this subreddit. People often go to people's accounts to dig up information because Reddit is a platform that encourages users to share information. People want to find out more about people, their opinions, and their past. It can be a fun way to learn more about someone, and it can also help people form opinions about others."
108,Why are Shorts (plus Instagram/Facebook reels) formatted so terribly?,"People making TikToks formatted for vertical videos. Professionals making YouTube shorts do to. But random YouTube clip farmers and instagram/Facebook people and people new to content creation who don’t want to do the extra work of making their horizontal videos with shorts in mind as well don’t. 

I went and scrolled through my suggested shorts after reading your comment and only saw maybe 10-20% with sides and tops cut off. But it was super noticeable.","Shorts (and Instagram/Facebook reels) are formatted so terribly because the videos are designed to be short and easily digestible. This means that the videos need to be formatted in a way that is easy to understand and quickly consumed. This means that the videos tend to be formatted with a lot of text and visual elements that can be quickly understood. Additionally, since the videos are designed to be short, the video quality is often not as good as longer videos, which can lead to a lower quality overall."
109,What if everyone stuck to the same prices?,"Titanic collapse?

That's been tried before in the early years of Communist Russia. Didn't work well at all.

The problem you run into very (very) quickly is that the environment around us doesn't respect human rules. 

If the wheat harvest is bad this year because of bad weather ... but you can't raise the price on wheat? 

A hell of a lot of wheat farmers can't raise enough money this year to plant next year's wheat, they just say ""fuck it"" and find some other line of work.","If everyone stuck to the same prices, it would create an unfair marketplace in which some businesses would not be able to compete. This could lead to a lack of competition, resulting in higher prices for consumers, lower quality products, and fewer options available."
110,"Tesla is a company with an image of being very R&D heavy. But their cars are not exactly known for their mechanical quality. Did they just decide ""we'll focus on software/electrical, even though the product is primarily a mechanical machine""?","Tesla's USPs are all about having technology and infrastructure that other car companies don't. The basic mechanics of a car are pretty well understood, so there isn't much market share to be gained from doing a lot of research and slightly refining them. The poor build quality mostly reflects a lack of experience and urgency.","No, Tesla did not just decide to focus on software/electrical components for their cars. Tesla has invested heavily in research and development of both software and hardware components for their vehicles. This includes developing new battery technology, new motor technology, and advanced driver assistance systems. Tesla has also invested in improving the mechanical components of their cars, such as suspension and brakes. All of these efforts have resulted in a car that is both technologically advanced and mechanically sound."

113,Only for people from the US southwest: Would you consider NYC summers to be hot?,"Having lived in both places, yeah NYC gets pretty hot. Its also a lot more humid than most of the southwest so it feels warmer than it is.

Of course the days that will literally kill you are a lot rarer in NY. But that's probably changes since I left many years ago","That would depend on the individual's opinion. NYC summers are typically hot and humid, and temperatures often reach the mid-90s Fahrenheit (mid-30s Celsius). However, someone from the US Southwest may find this to be more mild than the summers they are used to."
114,How much did it cost in the 90s or before the advent of Skype/Whatsapp to make international phone calls?,About a $1per minute.,"The cost of international phone calls in the 90s and before the advent of Skype/Whatsapp depended on the type of phone service being used. Generally, international calls made from landline phones were the most cost-effective, with rates as low as 10 cents per minute. Calls made from cell phones were usually more expensive, with rates ranging from 25 cents to $1 per minute. In addition, many countries required customers to pay a surcharge for international calls."
115,Universal Basic Income (UBI): Solution to Income Inequality or a Path to Dependency?,"It’s not a solution to income inequality but it’s a solution to ensuring people are able to pay their bills. 

Honestly, if people loved welfare, we’d all be on it. I think thats substantial evidence that people want to be working and earning enough to live comfortably and treat themselves - just in jobs that pay well, have reasonable hours and foster positive working environments. 

I like UBI. It should be enough to at least cover an average monthly mortgage repayment.","Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a policy proposal that would provide a guaranteed income to all citizens regardless of their employment status. Proponents of UBI argue that it could provide a viable solution to income inequality as it would provide a financial safety net to those in need and help reduce poverty. Critics, however, worry that UBI could lead to dependency on government assistance and disincentivize individuals from working.

At this point, UBI is still an untested policy proposal and its effects remain uncertain. A successful UBI program could potentially reduce poverty and inequality, while also providing an incentive to work by allowing individuals to supplement their income with the basic income payment. On the other hand, a poorly designed UBI program could lead to overreliance on government assistance and ultimately increase poverty and inequality.

Ultimately, the success of UBI will depend on how it is implemented. If done correctly, UBI could be a viable solution to income inequality. However, if not carefully designed and monitored, it could easily become a path to dependency."
116,Is it a recent phenomenon to find animals cute?,"I think all life has always had a charm, but domestication of many animals certainly takes away any perceived threat.

When an animal is controlled, subservient and bred to appeal to us - attraction is accentuated

We are the apex predator now, we control almost everything - as societies become more developed threats are extinguished.

We’ve used animals as pets, protection and support for millennia, I imagine civilisations past also marvelled at life in all its forms too","No, it is not a recent phenomenon to find animals cute. Human beings have been expressing affection for animals throughout history, whether through artwork, literature, or other forms of expression."

119,"In the movie ""One Hour Photo"", why did they have a fictional retail company (SavMart) but a real-life photography company (Agfa)?","Probably product placement or licensing. They might not have been able get the rights to use an actual mall or nobody wanted their brand to be associated with the film, but Afga maybe thought the film put their product in a good light (decent photo quality perhaps?) and agreed to be used / asked to be used?","The filmmakers wanted to create a sense of realism in the movie, so they used a real-life photography company (Agfa) to represent the photo processing services offered by the fictional retail store SavMart. This allowed viewers to be immersed in the world of the film and to relate more easily to the story. Additionally, using Agfa gave the film more credibility and helped to create a believable atmosphere."
120,Are our systems designed in a way to manage unexpected unusual never seen before incidents?,"No, our systems often break down pretty terribly when things like that happen. People might be able to cobble together a solution, which they can use a guide if it happens again in the future, but that's not guaranteed. A lot of times, it's just a matter of taking the easiest solution and pretending it never happened.

One actual example of this would be the story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri (which inspired the movie The Terminal), where a guy basically ended up in an international airport with no valid/official documentation, and just had to live in that airport for decades.","No, most systems are not designed to manage unexpected, unusual, and never seen before incidents.

As for your question

A lot of blind people still have partial sight. So if they take out their phone whatever to make a call or scan a sign to be read aloud leave them be. Don't be that asshole that's like ""how can you be blind if you're using a Cell phone?????""

There's probably a website by the blind with guidelines","1. Speak directly to the person, not to a companion who may be with them.
2. When offering assistance, ask the individual if they need help before you touch them or their cane or guide dog.
3. Let the individual take your arm or guide you, rather than taking their arm.
4. When speaking, try to maintain a consistent volume and pace.
5. Avoid using phrases such as “see you later” or “look at this” as these can be confusing for the individual.
6. Avoid using hand gestures when speaking, as blind people may not be able to see them.

8. When you are finished speaking, let the person know so they can respond.
9. Always be patient and respectful when interacting with a blind person."
123,Why do American police do ridiculous sobriety tests on motorists when they have a breathalyser?,"Lawyer here. I’ve handled a few duis in my day. The field sobriety “tests” aren’t really “tests” at all. They are to establish further evidence against you for use at trial. The truth is that the police officer isn’t deciding, based on the tests, whether or not to put you back in the car and send you in your way. The police officer made the decision to arrest you the second he pulled you out of the car. 

The tests are only to bolster the case, not to verify if you are OK to drive. Put another way, I have never once heard of a cop field sobriety testing someone then deeming they were OK and letting them go. 

Also lastly— the breathalyzer often has admissibility problems. The roadside one is in many states is inadmissible. The tester in the station, usually the draeger alcotest, has faced issues particularly in Massachuestts (since the science behind it is total bullshit)","The purpose of a sobriety test is to gain additional evidence of impairment that the results of a breathalyzer may not show. A breathalyzer only measures the amount of alcohol in a person’s system. However, a sobriety test can help to determine if a person’s physical and mental abilities are impaired due to the consumption of alcohol. The tests are designed to assess a person’s balance, coordination, reaction time, and motor skills, and can help to determine if they are too impaired to safely operate a motor vehicle."

126,How do dog owners who let their dog stick his head out of the car window know he won't jump out?,"They don't. It's dumb to let them do that with the window all the way down, dogs jump out somewhat often.","Dog owners who let their dog stick his head out of the car window should ensure that the windows are rolled up and the dog is securely tethered to a seat belt or harness. Additionally, it is important to monitor the dog’s behavior to ensure they are not trying to jump out.

128,What would the world be like if humans didn't need to sleep?,I imagine a lot of our sleep time would be spent working instead,"If humans didn't need to sleep, the world would be a very different place. People would have much more time in the day to work, study, and pursue leisure activities. However, the lack of sleep could have a significant impact on people's mental and physical health. Without regular rest, the body would be unable to repair itself and maintain proper functioning. This could lead to a variety of health issues including an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic illnesses.

It could be that you are feeling overwhelmed by the task and don't know where to start, or it could be that you lack the confidence and motivation to complete the task. It could also be that the task is too difficult, or you don't have the necessary skills or resources to complete it. 

It is important to identify the underlying cause of your procrastination and anxiety in order to effectively address it. It may be helpful to talk to a professional or seek out resources to help you develop the skills and confidence to complete the task.

140,How do you tell someone that you're feeling bad without sounding cringy or over-dramatic?,"It’s probably better to share now than let it pile up and become what you may then view as a “real issue.” I used to bottle it up and it only came to bite me in the butt later. Keep people in the loop and updated. It’s healthy!

As far as how to start, I’d just keep it short/light and let them ask the questions from there. You don’t have to pour out an hour monologue if that is what you feel is “over-dramatic.” See how they respond first and go from there.

Hope that helps!","It's okay to be honest and open about how you are feeling. Instead of over-dramatizing, try to explain your feelings in a straightforward and honest way.

Make sure to spend quality time with each of them individually and make sure to communicate your appreciation for their presence in your life. Additionally, it may be helpful to have honest conversations with each of them about your relationship and how you feel. This can help to create a sense of understanding and compassion between all of you."
152,how tall do you think i would reach?,"I can't really guess but I will say

Most males are almost done growing by 16. Anything after this is usually not that significant. After 19, you're almost certainly done.",I cannot answer that question for you as everyone's height is different and is determined by a variety of factors.
153,How does having too little norepinephrine cause anxiety?,"It's interesting how our brain chemistry works in mysterious ways, isn't it?!","Having too little norepinephrine can cause anxiety because it is a neurotransmitter involved in the body's fight-or-flight response. When there is not enough norepinephrine available, the body may become overly sensitive to perceived threats, leading to feelings of fear, panic, and anxiety. Low levels of norepinephrine can also lead to difficulty concentrating, sleeping, and regulating emotions."
154,Why “cope” become such a bad word when everyone have to cope in someway ?,Where are you seeing that used as a bad word?,"The word ""cope"" has become a bad word because it often implies an inability to address or solve a problem. People tend to associate it with a lack of progress or a feeling of being stuck in a difficult situation. However, everyone must cope with life in some way in order to move forward and find solutions to their problems."

158,Why are there so many famous witches named Agatha?,It's just the way the names sound and because of some stereotypes maybe. Just the way how one type of women is popularly called 'Karen' these days.,"Agatha is a popular name for witches because it is derived from the Greek word agathos, which means “good” or “kind.” This name has become associated with witches due to its connection to the goddess Agatha, who was said to be a powerful healer and protector of women. Agatha is also the patron saint of nurses, which may explain why the name has become so associated with witches."
159,Does British people use British accent when they are reading in their mind ?,"Please don't ""practice a British accent"".

In very much the same way I don't practice an American accent, you will only be judged harshly for your efforts.

Please, be yourself, enjoy the British culture, and if there are some troubles with communication, please feel free to ask someone to repeat themselves or explain their meaning.

Most British types won't mind if you need a little help. We're mostly friendly over here. Just beware the cockneys, and the mancunian spiceheads","This is not necessarily the case. While some people may read in their mind using a British accent, others may read in their mind using a different accent or no accent at all. It is a personal preference."
160,Why do German and Dutch toilets have a poop shelf?,So the poopwater doesn't splash up your ass,"Many toilets in German and Dutch homes have a poop shelf, also known as a ‘Schüssel’ or ‘Klosett’, which is designed to reduce the amount of splashing when using the toilet. This is done by allowing the user to position their waste on the shelf, which is slightly above the exit of the toilet bowl. This helps to reduce the amount of water that is splashed up onto the user and the surrounding area."
161,Why aren’t the majority of juries hung?,"The opinions of jurors aren't independent random coin-flips: they should all be highly correlated because they're all based on the evidence presented at trial.

Your experience of trying to ""get people to agree on something"" will be a skewed sample, because you _actively notice_ the controversial topics (like politics), and _don't often discuss_ the topics of universal agreement (like ""the sky is still blue today"", or ""that building over there is a thing that exists"")

Ideally a trial should involve prosecutors presenting a lot of clear and persuasive evidence for the charges, and _most_ trials are going to be fairly simple - not high legal drama with a lot of tricky interpretation to be done. It might not be entirely rational to have taken a clear-cut case to trial rather than making a deal, but some people still want to roll the dice on it. Maybe they just aren't offered a particularly good deal, so *why not* try the option that might get a better outcome; or maybe they really are innocent and want to assert that strenuously rather than plea out to even a minor sentence.","The majority of juries are not hung because jurors take their role seriously and make a good faith effort to reach a unanimous verdict when considering a case. It is very rare for a jury to be unable to come to a unanimous decision, as it requires all jurors to agree that there is reasonable doubt in the case."
162,"Dog. I saw this Dog outside a shop, waiting for his owner, no lead on it or anything. His eyes looked so sad.","Dogs can look sad without actually being sad, especially certain breeds.

Check out basset hounds, their droopy faces make them look permanently sad but they aren't.

You're attributing human facial expressions to dogs and they don't always directly translate. Some dogs ""smile"" when they're nervous or being aggressive for example.",It looked like he was waiting for someone to come and take him home.

164,Why did The Rolling Stones and The Cars remove the “The” from their band names?,"Neither has changed their name. 

Go to their official websites and you will see ‘The’.","The Rolling Stones and The Cars both removed the “The” from their band names in order to make their names easier to remember and more recognizable. The Rolling Stones originally named themselves after a Muddy Waters song, and The Cars chose to drop the “The” because it was already a popular phrase used to describe a car. By dropping the “The,” both bands were able to stand out more and make their names more memorable."

Spend time with people who lift you up and make you feel good about yourself. Focus on setting and achieving goals so you can make progress in life. Don't be afraid to take risks and try new things, because even if you fail, you will learn valuable lessons. Believe in yourself and don't let anyone discourage you from achieving your dreams."
167,Do you ever wonder about the people that intentionally went missing after 9/11?,"I doubt there were many if any. It would be really hard to last this long in the modern world with no documentation, and not even a plan for how to pull this off, because there wasn't a warning the attacks were coming.

I get that 40% of the people who died on 9/11 have no remains that have been recovered and/or identified, and it can spur all kinds of conspiracy theories, but they reality was they were humans in a blender. Their bodies were crushed into tiny pieces, then left in a pile that was burning for months, with further exposure to the elements after that. That's about as bad a condition as human remains can be subjected to.","Yes, I often think about the people who intentionally went missing after 9/11 and wonder what happened to them. It's a heartbreaking mystery that unfortunately may never be solved."
168,"If the military can airdrop vehicles like Humvees, why can't smaller aircraft such as Cessnas and Pipers be equipped/modified with mandated, dependable parachute deployment systems to help minimize impact during crash landings?",There's a commercially available parachute system for small planes IIRC.,"There are a few reasons why smaller aircraft such as Cessnas and Pipers cannot be equipped with mandated, dependable parachute deployment systems to help minimize impact during crash landings. Firstly, the size and weight of the aircrafts would need to be taken into consideration when designing the parachute deployment system, as the system would need to be able to effectively support the weight of the aircraft. Secondly, the costs associated with designing, testing, and implementing such a system could be prohibitive, and the installation of the system would require extensive changes to the aircraft's structure. Finally, the effectiveness of the system in minimizing impact during crash landings could be difficult to predict, as the system would be dependent on factors such as wind speed, altitude, and the condition of the aircraft at the time of deployment."

She did nothing to earn it, she has no notion of value. Laugh at her. She’s fucking ridiculous.","Some girls may feel the need to show off their expensive goods as a way to display their wealth and status.

In AC Mirage, the story is told through a unique set of characters, as opposed to Odyssey and Valhalla, which rely heavily on known historical figures. In addition, the narrative in AC Mirage is more focused on the present day, while Odyssey and Valhalla tell stories that span centuries."
177,Do I still absorb all the calories if I have diarrhea right after I eat something?,"No. AFAIK after breaking down in your stomach the food gets progressively squeezed and absorbed along your intestines. Water and nutrients are extracted along the walls. 

Diarrhea is sort of the opposite and your intestines flood with water to quickly eject the contents. 

I have no idea how much nutrition you end up keeping. But I think it’s a matter of time and how long you had to absorb anything.","Yes, you still absorb all of the calories if you have diarrhea right after eating something. Diarrhea does not prevent the body from absorbing the calories from the food. However, it can cause you to lose some of the nutrients that the food contains."
178,Sleep paralysis?,"It's just a terrible feeling. Yes, this happens to people. It doesn't just happen to you.","Yes, sleep paralysis is a phenomenon that occurs when a person is conscious but unable to move or speak. It can be a frightening experience, but it is not dangerous. It usually occurs when a person is transitioning between stages of sleep, and most people who experience it will do so only a few times in their lives. Treatment for sleep paralysis typically involves lifestyle changes, such as improving sleep hygiene, reducing stress levels, and avoiding sleeping on the back."

182,Is there any hope of humans visiting distant solar systems?,"It's very unlikely.  From everything we understand about physics, it's just not possible to travel faster than light speed, and that's a very slow speed on the scale of interstellar or especially intergalactic travel.  There are theoretical ways around this, but they all require conditions that might well not be possible to ever generate.

One big clue here is that most astronomers and planetary scientists are of the opinion that life is all over the place.  If that's true, and it sure does seem likely, and it's possible to travel much faster than light, why don't we see technological civilizations just about everywhere capable of supporting that sort of life?  I mean, someone out there would presumably have developed this ability long, long ago, and would have colonized much of the galaxy by now.

It's possible that we'll send humans to some other system eventually, but I wouldn't bet on it, sadly.","Yes, there is hope of humans visiting distant solar systems. Advances in space travel technology, such as ion propulsion and nuclear fusion propulsion, may eventually lead to the development of spacecraft capable of traveling to other star systems. Such a journey would likely take decades or centuries to complete, but it may one day become a reality."

185,Why is gender affirming care the option medical professionals choose?,"Hey OP, I'm a non-binary trans person and while many of the responses answer parts of your question, it seems no one has addressed it as a whole, so I'm happy to break it down into parts for you addressing each part of your question:  


1. **Altering the body to match the mind (are there other conditions where we do this?)**  
Actually, yes! Body Integrity Disorder is one such mental disorder, in which the individual believes a body part ""does not belong to them"" or should be amputated. For decades we tried to treat BID with therapy and medication, but found that the individual's distress would only remit once the offending limb was removed. Therapy and pharmaceutical intervention were so ineffective that p*eople with BID would find other, non-medical ways to remove or amputate their limbs, often leading to complications, sepsis, and death*.  
If you interview people with BID post amputation they overwhelmingly report their quality of life has improved, *even though they are now disabled*\--and here's another kicker, there are often no other signs of mental illness. BID isn't associated with histrionic personality disorder, or some type of munchausen's.   
In brain scans of individuals with BID, you can see the center of the brain associated with that part of the body is not functioning properly. Short of developing some type of complex neurosurgery to fix it, this is the best option we have.  
*(Quick note here: there is a common myth that trans people have brain scans that align with their preferred gender--this myth was perpetuated in part to normalize the acceptance of trans people back in the 90's, but it's continued perpetuation is harmful not only because it is scientifically false, but because it invalidates the gender identities of non-binary trans people. there is actually no such ""test"", nor are there structural differences between a ""male"" and ""female"" brain--though hormones do have a noticable impact on biological function and can in some senses change the brain, you wouldn't be able to see this pre-HRT. more on this later)*  
**Despite some interesting face value similarities between Body Integrity Disorder and Gender Dysphoria, BID and its treatment is fundamentally different from something like gender dysphoria and gender reassignment surgery, which are only partially related to discordance with the body.**  
This is because **there are many types of dysphoria**\--***body dysphoria*** (relating to the body as a whole/gender presentation), ***bottom dysphoria*** (relating to genitals), and ***social dysphoria*** (the way people are perceived socially and culturally in terms of their gender) are some of the most common--though there are other types of dysphoria as well, such as voice dysphoria, height dysphoria, etc.  
It is also important to note here is that **not all trans people even have dysphoria-**\-many trans people simply have EUphoria from presenting or transitioning to the other gender. Additionally, non-binary trans people (who identify neither identify not as a man or a woman but as something between those states) may choose to do hormone replacement therapy to alter their body composition or voice, but *not t*heir secondary sex characteristics (breasts, genitals), OR they may get Gender Affirming Surgery (such as top surgery to remove the breasts) but opt not do HRT.  
**There is a HUGE range of types of trans and non-binary trans people, and within that range there are an endless amount of expressions and identities.**   
Some of us have social dysphoria but not body dysphoria. Some of us get surgery and HRT and others don't. Some of us change or names and pronouns but don't change anything else. Some of us do a mix of the above, caring selectively about some things but not others. I know some trans women, for example, who had profound social and body dysphoria but not bottom dysphoria, so they took estrogen and transitioned socially but did not take Testosterone blockers, and therefore retain full use of their penis.  

2. **Why do people get to choose their gender?**  
**We don't.**   
That's kind of the point, actually.We were born into the bodies we were born into, and if we're the lucky 99%, our bodies match the gender we are. If we are the unlucky 1% that is born trans, we have to negotiate with our bodies, hormones, and socially constructed societal roles to change what doesn't feel right in order to lead authentic lives.I don't know your gender, OP, but imagine if you woke up tomorrow in the gender of the opposite sex. How long do you think you'd survive before you lost your mind? Once the novelty wore off, you'd be left horrified, isolated, and dysphoric. Living this way is unsustainable for trans people, and we don't get to choose it. There isn't something wrong with our brain, like there is with other mental disorders--and the ONLY reason it is coded in the DMS as a ""disorder"" is so that therapy for gender dysphoria can be coded and billed through insurance. It is a common misconception that being in the DMS somehow validates that trans people are mentally ill. Know what else is in the DMS? GRIEF. This is so people suffering from the loss of a loved one can get insurance to cover their therapy.  

3. **""Why can't we align the mind with the body rather than the body with the mind?""**  
Because there is nothing broken with the mind. We have decades of neuroscience to substantiate this. Gender is, in large part, a social construct--*but this does not invalidate the REALNESS of that construct.* **We have a personal relationship with our bodies, just as we do with our minds, they are not separate entities.**   
If you went blind, or lost your ability to speak, you would feel like you were losing a part of yourself, not JUST your body, right? A huge part of our identity as humans relates directly to our bodies, how they are perceived, and how we perceive the world through them.  
It's really no different with trans people. There is a feeling of LOSS as well as a feeling of BURDEN, and **the need to attenuate the loss by ""adding"" what is missing** (breasts, a penis, longer hair) **and ""subtracting"" what is burdensome** (facial hair, a penis, beasts) **is really the only way to make people feel whole.** Some trans people require only a select few of these additions and subtractions, and some require all of them. Needing one, some, or all does not make people any more or less trans than someone else though, because being trans really just means we don't identify with the gender we were assigned at birth.   

4. **ON GENDER AFFIRMING CARE FOR CIS PEOPLE**  
I am actually a HUGE supporter of GAC for ALL people, not just trans people. You're a cis man who can't get hard and need to take Viagra? You should take it! You're a cis woman who feels like less of a woman bc you're flat chested and want breast implants? Get them!  
**Gender Affirming Care and HRT (hormone replacement therapy) is actually routinely practiced  for cisgendered people in the medical field--we just haven't politicized that as much (yet).**   
For example, menopausal women are routinely prescribed hormone replacement therapy in the form of birth control to level out their hormone levels as they drop or fluctuate due to menopause.   
Similarly, it is not uncommon for cisgendered men to receive extra testosterone due to low T levels, which can have debilitating health impacts.   
Gender affirming care is also crucial for intersex people, who may have phenotypically male or female presenting bodies but are hormonally misaligned, or you have conditions where a man was born with ovaries, or a woman was born without a uterus, and needs to be on medication to correct hormone imbalances. We don't talk about intersex people much, but they do exist and in higher numbers than you'd think. Some people even go their whole lives without knowing they're intersex at all, until they try to conceive, or have other medical complications later in life.  
**The reality is that EVERYONE--cisgender, transgender, intersex, and those with medical conditions all need access to quality health care, including gender specific medical interventions.**   
Of course, in an ideal world, we should all have access to what we need to feel happy, healthy, and whole. **The reason TRANS affirming care is prioritized over CIS gender affirming care is because without gender affirming care, trans people simply kill themselves.**  


I just want to say, OP, I really appreciate you coming here and asking this question with an open mind and an open heart. There is so much misinformation and propaganda out there and so many people who want to hurt and kill us for being different.   
**Trans people don't want special treatment,** ***we want the same things you do*****--to lead a life where we can wake up in the morning and feel comfortable in our bodies, where we can struggle and suffer and triumph and succeed, where we can find love and love ourselves.**   
That's it. That's all it is.   
And it starts with people like you, asking questions in good faith and being willing to hear the answers.","Gender affirming care is the option medical professionals choose because it is a form of medical care that is based on the understanding that gender identity is a personal experience and that it is not necessarily linked to a person's sex assigned at birth. This type of care is designed to provide comprehensive and holistic care that respects the patient's gender identity and acknowledges their right to self-determination. This type of care also focuses on helping individuals to navigate the healthcare system and access the care they need. It is a way to ensure that all patients, regardless of their gender identity, receive the care and respect they deserve."
186,I need advice I haven’t left my home in 6 days,"I've got no advice for you, but this seems like a good place for r/casualconversation","It's important to make sure you're taking care of yourself during this time. Here are some things you can do to stay physically and mentally healthy: 

- Take breaks from screens and get outside if you can (even if it's just for a few minutes).
- Practice deep breathing and mindfulness to reduce stress.
- Exercise regularly, even if it's just a short walk around your neighborhood.
- Stay connected with friends and family through video calls or text messages.
- Eat healthy, balanced meals and get plenty of rest.
- Find ways to stay busy and productive, such as reading, doing puzzles, or learning a new skill.
- Seek help if you need it. Talk to a therapist or counselor if you're struggling."
187,Are these two situations similar?,"I've got no advice for you, but this seems like a good place for r/casualconversation","No, the two situations are not similar. Each situation has its own unique set of characteristics, so it is not possible to make a direct comparison between them."
188,"If I always wake up on my own after sleeping for 9 hours, does that mean that I must change my routine to consider it?",You sleep 9 hours straight?,"Yes, if you want to maintain a healthy sleep pattern it is important to consider changing your routine if you find that you are consistently waking up after 9 hours of sleep. You may want to consider gradually decreasing the amount of time you spend sleeping, so that you can establish a pattern of sleeping for shorter periods of time and still feeling rested. Additionally, it may be helpful to establish a regular bedtime routine and to avoid using screens before bed."
189,Why do people hate centrist so much,"The answer is very rarely actually in the middle, but centrists don’t want to be involved enough in the news to make the hard decision on which side is actually right. The ascended centrist who believes they are smarter than everyone for saying both sides bad is also pretty common and annoying, especially on the internet","?

Centrists are often seen as politically opportunistic, unwilling to take a stance on any particular issue and instead trying to please everyone. This is often seen as a sign of weakness, and people may be frustrated that centrists are not taking a firm stance on important issues. Additionally, some may view centrists as not having a true ideological identity and instead as simply trying to cater to the majority opinion."
190,How did gay people in the 1900s and earlier ‘identify’ each other to have a relationship with despite the harsh stigma/ punishments ?,"People will always develop ways to ""hint"" at things. One famous example is during the WW2 era, if someone asked you if you were a ""friend of Dorothy,"" that was code for asking if you were gay. People relied on a combination of hidden things like code phrases, and just staying low-key (as long as you were still considered an upstanding member of society and ""publicly"" heterosexual, they were less likely to investigate your personal life too much).","Due to the harsh stigma and punishments associated with homosexuality in the early 1900s, it was often difficult for LGBTQ people to identify each other and form relationships. Many gay people used coded language and symbols to recognize potential partners. For example, they might wear a certain type of clothing or jewelry, or use certain phrases or words to indicate that they were also LGBTQ. In some cases, LGBTQ people would frequent certain bars or clubs that were known to be safe spaces for members of the community. They might also attend certain events where they were more likely to meet someone with similar interests."
191,How deep does a nuclear device have to be to not have an upsurge of earth on the surface when it is detonated for an underground test?,"This'll depend a lot on the size of the bomb, but there was a bomb that was detonated 900ft underground in a special tunnel that produced very minimal surface effects. Deeper tests can be thousands of feet deep.","The depth of an underground nuclear test depends on a variety of factors, including the size and type of device, the type of soil and rock in the area, and the desired yield of the test. Generally speaking, larger and more powerful devices require deeper tests, and depths of up to several thousand feet may be necessary to prevent an upsurge of earth on the surface."
192,AT&T free phone,"It's $1000 in bill credits over 36 months.  Cancel service or change phones early and you immediately owe the remaining balance.  (It's also subject to a credit check, and a $230 trade in value required for the full offer)","AT&T does not offer free phones.

193,Can you think of another social media site that is better than Reddit?,Literally every other site except tiktok.,"That's a subjective question, and the answer will depend on the individual. Some people may find Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram to be better than Reddit, while others may prefer sites like Tumblr or Pinterest."
194,Can you die from a burning electric wire smell?,Open the window at least,"No, you cannot die from a burning electric wire smell. However, it is important to take proper precautions when dealing with a burning electric wire, as it can cause a fire and potentially cause serious injury or death."
195,How does computer coding work?,"ELI5 Version:

So your computer is basically just a whole bunch of really, really, really small gates that are opened/closed by electricity.  A gate can only be open or closed, it can't be part way open.  An open gate is represented by a ""0"" and a closed gate is represented by a ""1.""  This is ""binary"" and it's the deepest level of ""code"" in your computer, literally just strings like `10101100110101110100` that represent parts of your computer circuits having power or not having power.

Now obviously coding in binary would be pretty difficult, because humans can't look at `110100100` and know that it represents the number 420.  Back in the day you'd use [punchcards](https://i.imgur.com/XR6ET2o.png) to code computers, that you'd literally punch holes into, with the filled/not filled holes representing 1s or 0s.  Seeing as it's not 1950 anymore though we've got better ways of doing things, we've got other languages that we can use (C++, Plython, C#, Assembly etc), this is what your son is using.

If you wanted to print ""Hello World"" in python you'd code it as `print('Hello, world!')`, as a human being looking at that you can probably figure out what that does, your computer doesn't know what it means though.  So your computer translates it (like you would translate a language irl) into binary code and the excites the 1s and 0s (as in turning power to stuff on/off).

To answer your question more specifically when you're looking at a game there are two main elements you need to consider, the graphics (what you literally see on the screen) and the logic (the code behind it).  The grass in fortnight is an image that is saved onto your computer and the computer has to execute code in order to grab that image and know how to display it on a screen, but someone didn't code every part of that image by hand.  They just took a photo of some grass and the computer is being told to pull up that photo and display it on the ground in-game.

However the player does need to interact with that grass, as in their player character needs to be able to stand on top of it and walk around on it, and that logic needs to be coded into the game.","Computer coding is a process of writing instructions for a computer to follow. These instructions, which are written in a programming language, tell the computer what to do and how to do it. The instructions are written in the form of commands, functions, and algorithms, which are then compiled or interpreted into a language that the computer can understand and execute."
196,Is it weird that I'm only attracted to stereotypically geeky looking DILFs twice my age?,"Not really - everyone has a preference, some People’s are more obscure","No, it isn't weird at all. Everyone has different preferences and attractions, so there is nothing wrong with having a type."

198,How do right wingers react if they see a minority in public?,"""Right-wingers"" ... in what country?","This is a difficult question to answer as reactions vary from individual to individual. Some right wingers may be indifferent, while others may be uncomfortable or even hostile. It is important to remember that everyone is different and that it is impossible to generalize the behavior of an entire group of people."
199,Is it normal to think about past friends everyday?,"It sounds a bit maladaptive, to be honest.  It can be difficult to let go of connections, but most people would have by now.  Keeping imaginary versions of your former friends inside your head isn't normal, no.  

When I was younger, I had a long term issue with maladaptive daydreaming.  While it made me feel safe, it also caused me to isolate myself and avoid connections with others.  

If you feel like this is negatively affecting your life, therapy could help.","No, it is not normal to think about past friends every day. Everyone experiences different levels of grief and nostalgia, but if you find that your thoughts about past friends are excessively negative or are causing you distress, it might be helpful to speak to a mental health professional."
